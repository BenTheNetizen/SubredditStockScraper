My position tomorrow is the fetal position
I only have $800 in my account but I managed to lose $1100
I'm investing in Vlad because of how much he appreciates.
It was a pleasure losing money with y’all today, gentlemen.
Today is red in honor of mars. I accept this loss for NASA
I thought stonks only go up. I would like a refund please.
I got fucking murdered today
Idea for Robinhood - Achievements!

"Congratulations you have unlocked the '5 days in the red Achievement!''
What even is the point of closing the market ? Things doesn’t even stop. Extended hours should just be the hours now.
my general takeaway from GME hearing today is that Boomers cant figure out their webcams, mics or how the markets actually operate... but they run the country.
Sold RIOT puts for a loss yesterday, would've been over 100% gain if I held and sold today.  Switched to calls on the dip today and am down 90%.  Am I doing this right?
4 months of gains. Gone. Basically my entire trading portfolio expiring tomorrow 

Thanks for the dump Solar. 

FOOOK MEEEEEE REEEEEEEEEEEE
the second they announce stimulus checks are on the way u bears are once again fucked
Attn NEWBS:

Days like today are when you buy. Dont buy just because u have money. Wait. These days come. Sometimes they get worse for 2-3 days. This is the dip

BUY THE FUCKIN DIP
Does anyone Remember when we had green days
Got a strange feeling that tomorrow will be green AF.
How do you undiscover options trading?
Down $10k and I ran out of weed. Nice.
cry while holding my GME shares
Just chiming in to say that I also got ass blasted today.

I’ve lost half of my money ($12k - $6k) in a week on PLTR calls, AAPL calls, and APHA shares. Thought I bought a dip on all of those.

F
My move? Not tell my gf I lost 6k. Fuck you PLTR and fuck you AMC lol.
My move tomorrow?  Taking another giant red dildo up the ass.  Or not. Preferably not.  Green dildo plz.
This week is straight bullshit.

Green Dildos prayer circle line starts here.
ALPHA TLRY pls stop
To the 7 million new members how was your first week
of an actual red market
Due to financial reasons, I will be passing away.
PLTR as flat as my wife's ass
Guys what the fuck is going on? This has been like the worst week of my life I’ve lost so much money
I'm just glad they fucking rang the bell
don’t rope gentlemen just hang in there
GME got *murdered* today
A PLTR is never late and never early, gay bears. It moons precisely when it means to.
Just give us a green day ffs
Since a lot of you have lost a ton of money and are trying to figure out how it all works, I’ll give you the answer key

I’m going to post this 3-4 times today a few hours apart because it’s important so sorry if you’re seeing it more than once
PLTR boys, we eating ramen or wagyu tomorrow?
That last hour was a massacre.
Bought some riot today at 62 and then sold at 66 and made 26 dollars. Fuck ya free lunch
Since joining WSB last month I've become desensitised to losing money...
*'Ackshually if you hold the shares for at least 5 years...."*


Shut the fuck up. This is wallstreetbets. What happened? You guys stopped playing options? We don't have time for that pussy r/investing bullshit.


If I wanted to be driving a Ferrari at 80 when my back cracks in the seat, trying to fuck models when my cock no longer works, eating at Michelin star restaurants with dead tastebuds, and finally get a vacation house my old eyes can barely appreciate the view of.....then I will ask you for advice.


Get rich young or fuck it.
I want you all to know that I would gladly throw you under the bus  for a green day
How tf am I down 84k in a bull market?

Your risk tolerance is wild enough for you to be here. You will get through this. Take a break and come back fresh. Don’t chase your losses. Talk to some comrades here about how dumb your plays were.

Update: I have moved into my car. May have to sell the wheels tomorrow. Thanks PLTR!
5 straight red days guh
This shit is a simulation. Seriously.
My options experience is buying based on a reasonable thesis, buying too early, having my options half in price and then just praying that I claw myself out of the hole over the next few days.
100k to 50k speed run in under two weeks. can anyone beat me?
Vlad’s story about being from Bulgaria is bullshit he has a perfect American accent maybe his great grandfather came over in 1910 but this mf grew up here and is just trying to justify his wack haircut
# i just looked at my 1099. holy fuck im retarded lmfaooo
I bought GME calls the first 3 times DFV spoke and sold when he stopped talking.  https://ibb.co/phbbt3b
Friendly reminder: we literally landed on Mars today. BULLISH AS FUCK.
DON’T MESS WITH TEXAS 

*Several inches of snow later*

PRAY FOR TEXAS
I’m tired of losing money. Can we please be super green tomorrow?
DONT YOU DARE INVESTIGATE WHETHER OR NOT I HAVE AN ADDICTION
Big green dildos are just ahead, fellas. Biden Bucks will be here soon to remind us that money is just a made up number
So like tomorrows definitely green cause a red week is illegal
PSA: Buying the dip works if you are buying shares or loading up on leaps.

Double downing on your weekly calls may not be the best interest.

Adding CNBC Editorial to me resumè
23, male, hobbies include selling for >50% losses and immediately regretting plays no matter how well planned. Low maintenance but startles easily. $20 obo.
Stock holders: ehh the markets will eventually bounce back

Option holders: This is the end of my portfolio
my portfolio is in the shitter and my mental health is next
My dog of 17 years died the other day. Work sucks. And now the market is blood red. I feel like $ROPEing. Send help.
**Bill Gates:** When I invested in impossible foods or beyond meat or quantumscape I was doing that just to help.

**CNBC Andrew Sorkin:** Did you short Tesla?

**Bill Gates:** Well you know I don't talk about my investments.

I went from 5k to 60k to 4k in a month and I don’t even care. Completely numb. Just numbers on a screen.
I've made more money growing weed than Sundial.
#SOME OF YOU BEARS ARE ^slightly ok. Don’t come to market tomorrow
Went from 25k to 1k in two weeks
I literally CAN NOT absorb another bloodbath like today. Lost almost two month’s salary today
If you’re a new member and experiencing heavily losses, you have 2 choices     
1) quit and say goodbye to WSB     
2) embrace your newly minted zebra stripes and let the mods knight you with a dildo blessing as you’re now one of us    
  
This is the way
there is a SERIOUS correlation between red days and lack of awards in the daily threads
Added 1000 shares of PLTR along with $10K in June '22 40 strike LEAPs.
dont be a pussy and buy PLTR. nothing else.
I think I'm just gonna all in on Palantir
Futures down 0.50%

WSB: we’re all gonna fucking die!!!
What a shitty red ass fucking week
i am never going to financially recover from this
I have now FOMO’d into a play about 15 times. I am 0 for 15. And I’ll fucking do it again.
My portfolio is in the red and I live in texas, how worse can this week get
PLTR may not be bullish but holy fuck I would be dumb not to take some positions on it at this price
Does anyone actually read The Motley Fool? Seems like it’s about 99% clickbait.
My fidelity account looks like normandy beach on d day
Imagine having so much money that just buying a stock and announcing you bought it makes it go up. Fuck these funds and shit play on easy mode
Wifes bf just saw his own shadow, looks like 1 more day of red. Sorry boys.
who else has 80% of portfolio in calls
Way too bearish in here bottom is in
Is anyone here actually making any money on anything?
Smells like bitch in here

Yall chill the fuck out with the doomsday shit you're making the bears horny
The other "investing subs" are so fascinating in comparison to wsb being oddly frugal because of our gambling addictions.

You hop on r/acorns and see *"Hey guys, so I stopped drinking $30 coffees every day and it turns out it adds up!"*

Meanwhile this place has 6 figure accounts I would bet drive beaters and wear jeans that faded 5 years ago.
My personal investment strategy is I invest in CEO’s with the best hair. You know I had to pick PLTR
-20% today. Feels bad man
Pray for a green Friday
When RH actually IPO, you'll be able to buy as many shares as you can on unlimited margin but you can't sell. It's a feature that is made to protect the user.
140 pages of trades in a yaer, barely any profit. 

was fun tho.
One day I’ll be right on a play
Let me tell you how this plays out tomorrow and save you some trouble:

1. SPY opens down -.45%
2. SPY retreats to -.95% by noon
3. SPY moves between -1.1% and -.65% between 1 and 2:30 PM
4. SPY slow-climbs to end the day -.09% before the weekend

VXX and VIX somehow end the day -1.3%

The problem with making 100% returns in 3 months is you start to think that shit is normal... 

Kinda like when you watch porn and see everyone has a monster dick and there's you with your average 6 incher feeling sad.
My first market dip. I feel truly alive
i miss the days when stonks only went up
If PLTR hits $30 tomorrow I am going to make a shit ton of money
Oh no hope I don’t get margarine called
Buying PLTR AND NIO dip
We just gonna ignore the fact that Vlad appreciated every single fucking question?
Lie down. Try not to cry. Cry a lot.
Mama Cathie added $132 mil in $PLTR today.
I have a feeling Bumble is going to fuck me harder than anyone I've met from Bumble.
PLTR AH has me rock hard
It honestly makes me feel so much better knowing you retards are suffering alongside me this week. And if you aren’t, fuck you.
I just ate a disgusting amount of sushi.
If PLTR dips tomorrow I will have no money to buy the dip... I will also have no money in general. Very sad!
This is your sign to sell everything and YOLO PLTR
Market rallied hard during the worst of the virus and now it's crashing now that virus is going away.
Going to taco truck and spending $10 on tacos. No trading tomorrow. Need a break
How do I buy the dip when I go all in every time
If PLTR goes to 40 tomorrow I’ll get it as a tattoo
PLTR may be the new wave
Friday Apple announces new product lines: iGenomics, iSpace, iStar internet service. Kanye West age regresses to 21 years old and tweets as he passes Alpha Centauri in his iCapsule. Apple stock: -3%
Imagine being named Vlad and not being ripped af with a huge ass beard.
PLTR LETS RUN IT
Is it okay if I just all in PLTR today?
PLTR PLTR PLTR
13 grand on PLTR at close was an alright move
WSB would've been 100% in enron calls back in the day
# I am not a cat
Should I buy into pltr tonight/tomorrow or nah?
# red futures: pp soft

# mass extinction of noobs: pp hard
Time to wake up to -2.5% pre market on your positions tomorrow because who the fuck knows why
My coworker doesn’t know who the beastie boys are
Crying myself to sleep.

Goodnight guys
I figured I’d get up early in the morning to shower and shave so Im presentable when the market fucks me.
Green by open.
Anyone else lost all will to live with still at least half of life left to go?
I need a green day ASAP I haven’t shit in 3 days
One red day and everyone’s crying. Buncha big pooseys
Sediment here is bearish which is a signal for new and improved me to buy.
All i have to do is move my portfolio back to my watchlist and it'll be green again
Dear AAPL,

Why must you treat me so badly? After all that iCar talk you promised, I very excite. I hope you realize what you’re doing. Please change your way.

P.S. Still HODLIN
My portfolio is perfectly balanced with 80% of it in various pltr calls and leaps.
aight who switched from calls to puts today. reverse green uno card
I’m in absolute shambles
People act like Palantir dropped because they were involved in some child porn scandal or lost government contracts.... it's just share lock up lmao. If you missed this dip you fucking hate money.
lol thanks citadel for the GME discount. My
Average is 496, I’m not scared Melvin!
Tossed like 40k into ARK ETFs today so this Cathie lady better know what the fuck she’s doing
I hope pltr goes to 30 and you make money
PLTR to the moon
ALL IN PLTR. 30 SOON
If a dingleberry like Vlad can be the cofounder and ceo of a billion dollar company then imagine the things you can accomplish
I am never going to financially recover from this.
Cathie bought 5mil more PLTR
Dear Stock Market,

Pleas stop fucking me. 

Thanks,
DFV just tweeted and deleted this. Caught it just in time. If this isn’t absolute confirmation he’s holding idk what is https://imgur.com/a/8JK4ubQ
Buy more PLTR
I'm fighting for my fucking life
Thanks Obama
Market: Rotating out of tech.
Me: Rotating into homelessness
If you bought RIOT at $80 today you are a mega retard and I respect your autism.
ITS A SLAUGHTER 

*market down 0.003%*
Just think about it like this

Any money you've lost is your subscription cost to WSB
You might be leveraged past your personal risk tolerance if a dip 1.5% below ATH bankrupts you
>!Stonks only go up!<
#If you go to bed now futures will stay red

#If you stay up to watch them they might turn green
Anyone notice how they repeatedly mentioned the SEC chairmen is only temporary and they haven't confirmed a new one? I think they are subtly hinting that they might vote DFV in.
PLTR the type of stonk to bring you flowers and cake after raw-dogging your ass for 6 hours
Upvote if you’re retarded.
GME be like "only down 11% today, pretty bullish"
Don't lie to me u/zjz . Are your bots inversing my positions and making mad tendies?
Market switched from easy to medium difficulty in the last two days.
Senator, thank you for the question, that’s a very important question.
Can anyone explain why PLTR stayed at almost 25 for a few hours?
PLTR
damn, ppl just DONT Like AAPL
lmao CNBC just can't stop shitting on reddit They just said that redditors smell. 

Do they know how many non-basement dwelling, normal ass people there are on this site?
Who’s fuckin pounding beer after today?
Hey guys. I work at Citadel. Ken wants you to know you can just Venmo him directly @bigPPKenny
I'm shorting south Africa
Getting into trading has been the best and worst thing for me. Financially? I've been doing pretty good. Mentally? Well let's just say I wake up 15 minutes from opening bell screaming my lungs out and sweating bullets.
Biden when is that next stimulus coming mate? Need it asap.  And don't forget to make it obligatory that the stimulu can only be invested in EV or weed stonks.
If I turn my screen upside down then it’s a win
This whole gamestop thing has taught me 1 thing...

This game is rigged and its a total fucking casino. The house always wins unless you play by their boomer fucking rules. So im gonna play by their rules....WSB edition. Yoloing the rest of my port on F and SOXX leaps, and TSLA puts. 2023 expiry, and deleting my apps. Not looking at it for 2 years. Fuck it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

See yal on monday.
Motherfuckers act like they forgot about stimulus.
Now THIS is pod racing!
If SPY isn’t up at least 2% tomorrow I’m calling the SEC
I know some of you lost your ass to GME, Took whatever money you had left and put it in TLRAY, Probably panic sold that bought a low risk ETF like lCLN.
You retards should know by now... if Cathie buys, you buy 

$PLTR
If GME keeps sliding the way it is I'll buy more and my average cost basis will make me look less retarded.
I was told Buy Leaps get Sleeps,  I have been holding AAPL $130 and AMD $92.5 09/18/2021 Leaps since September 2020.  I haven't slept a wink.
Just a quick question. I’m trying to “buy the dip” - but can’t seem to find any more money. Ideas?
"I am not a cat"

line of the century
Guuuuys i diamond handed my tlry puts and now I’m fcking rich!!
One month of gains gone. Because they murdered my PLUG and FCEL! Red in a row for one whole fucking week!! Run out of money to buy the dip...
kinda expected today to be a blood bath, but I'm equally expectant tomorrow will be a better day
Kinda crazy to see the True GME Believers show up in these threads and legit talk about it hitting 1000 per share after it's dropped 400 from the peak lol
Let the PLTR avg down begin
pltr bought to moon mission to $33 tom just like the other day. Went up from 25 to 32.50 in one day. These were the easiest 28.5C odte I've ever made.. about to be a 3 bagger in a day.
PLTR
What are my moves tomorrow? How about curling up into a fetal position and crying
guys I’m so serious, whenever we see someone asking a question can the standard procedure be to respond with something along the lines of “first of all thank you for your question, it’s a pleasure to be here”
I like to just keep adding money to my account everyday so I never lose...
Imagine thinking PLTR gang is delusional but PLUG and FCEL gang are just “investing in the future”. LMAOOOoOo
PLTR lockup is classic sell the rumor buy the news
PLTR calls gonna printttttttt
Never thought a clean energy ETF in a Biden administration and a Dem majority would be the thing bending me over and destroying me. Get it together ICLN
GameStop is 90% of what it was, am I the only one still
Holding ?
Entire McDonald’s paycheck on apple calls at open $AAPL
Holy fuk Queen Cathie bought a shit ton of PLTR.
I bought PLTR end of day. Nice jump AH. Please dont trick me.
All in on PLTR
Alex Karp in sunglasses could fuck your mom 9 times out of 10. The other 1 time he’ll fuck your dad
PLTR to the moon
My portfolio was down by -7.8% today. One of my biggest down days ever, fuck.
I'm broke! Holding for a good green day. It's been red all week for me.
What a brutal day in the market.
Tomorrow i move deep into the red.
Tomorrow I go from red to crimson
closing all my green positions to buy more red ones
PLTR lockup sell off is over, so where does it go now ?? guess guess.
Yo how to buy puts on Texas
I um

I admit to always improving
it was great buying PLTR puts at the top and shit talking it all the way down only to sell the puts and buy a shit ton of PLTR shares @ $25. Dont be afraid to swing both ways, retards
Palantir LEAPs. That is all.
Worst part about shares is they dont expire. You have to actually admit defeat by selling.

You cant just get blackout drunk at open on expiry day and pass out before the bell and have your broker clean up your mess.
PLTR Jan 2023 $25 calls are like 13 bucks, may have to pick up a handful of those bad boys.
First off. I appreciate the question. 

Tomorrow I will buy more $CRSR , $IIPR, $TCEHY
Every single stock on the market has betrayed me
Sat on the sidelines for months waiting for a play like PLTR.  This week has been swell.
PLTR is up $1 after hours and my pp going up right now
Cathie just gave me green light to turn on margin and buy the palandip
Ever since GME, everything mentioned here is behaving like a P&D, i dont know if its outside manipulation or if its the new culture but im gonna stick around for the lolz and avoid the tickers like the plague
*futures red I bang my head*

*Futures green i touch my ween*
PLTR lets gooo!!! lockup what
Thank you PLTR, very cool!
remember those 2 sluts that would take off their clothes while recapping the week on wall street. I miss those hoes
Any remaining chance of a Robinhood IPO was snuffed out today
cowboy bebop goes so hard buy calls on all space stocks
Covid vaccine going well. Country be open soon. Stockmarket healthy
Hang in there buddy
GOING ALL IN ON GOURDS BABY
What do y'all do to de-stress after staring at charts for 10 hours straight?
Markets mooned into the close last Friday. This whole week has been a shit show. Fuck you.
All this new money getting WIPED OUT over -.5% makes me lol.
I am not a cat
I can't stop losing money so I'm going chew through my CRSR keyboard wire.
IS A GREEN DAY TOO MUCH TO ASK???
You gotta admit seeing all the bears come out is nostalgia level exciting if you've been here longer than a month.
I’m a simple man, I drink coffee with breakfast, and when I see PLTR dump 7% I buy call options.

PLTR 27c 2/26
You know what’s funny? SPY is still up .15% from this time last week. 

But reading this thread you’d get the impression we’re in the middle of March last year.
Bill Gates named Microsoft after his penis
Second day of my life owning stock second day losing my money lol I like the stock tho
It's pretty sad how empty my life is when I'm not making any money in the market. Legit, I live for green days. Days where I'm losing money are a struggle because it forces me to reflect that I got absolutely nothing going for me outside stocks lol.
Roll call soldiers. It was a bloody battle today.
Ja Rule, we need you to make sense of this
What are my moves tomorrow.

Jerk off and cry to REMs "Everybody Hurts" as I stare at the red in my portfolio.
Ravioli ravioli gimme the stimmioli
Somebody seems to want PLUG below $50 for this Friday. What is a good entry price?
Buy pltr
PLTR calls bought EOD.  
  
Cathie buys. I buys.
Yikes it’s bleak in here today. I don’t feel as bad being down 4% today. I’m so so glad that I read a comment that said, “put all your money in riot you can’t lose.” I sold my options immediately when I read that. Thank you to whoever gave me that euphoria top

#Bears fuk yet again lmaoooooooo
Damn I got gang raped today.
Bought more PLTR, I think it hit rock bottem today, but what do I know? I just really like the stock.....
Everyone start saying the opposite of your positions so we trick the algos

Stocks only go down, big bear, JPOW sucks, AMD $50 puts April 16th, rug pull coming
Gonna need one of those PLTR $10+ days to save my fds
Wallstreetbets

buy calls at the top

buy puts at the bottom

the circle of retardism
Pltr up 7% AH

Now we know what it never dipped below 25. Cathie had a 5M  buy order there
I don't buy high and sell low, I buy high and expire worthless.
Bought some more pltr in last min of AH—feeling very bullish
Melting snow just to flush the toilet, sir.
Unpopular opinion-

As a permabull, I get the biggest chubs on red days when I buy stuff on deep discount. Every day after pales to Buy day.
I should have bought more sndl puts im such a pussy
This lady lives in the apt under my and she just texted me “Hi! Are you okay up there?” And I have no idea why...

Like why would I not be okay. Is there something I’m missing.

She may have heard me swearing and muttering under my breath maybe as I looked at my accounts?

I don’t know

What do I say back?

Is she trying to have sex with a zaddy or just make sure I’m not going to jump off the roof?
PLTR up 1.23 AH. Keeeeeep going
I bought 1 $800 3/19 GME call at close. +$2 already
Contemplating just going all in PLTR shares and doing weekly CC.
Yea I totally fucked up my taxes lol
Y’all see that Mortal Kombat trailer. Im signing up for HBO Max to watch it. Nostalgia at its best.  Calls on $T
Scared money dont make no money, aka watch a stock go up for a month only to muster up the courage to buy the top, no fear the key
What do you think is wiser given the same amount of cash:

1. Getting a lambo

2. Down payment on a mansion

3. PLTR FD’s
I put the house on PLTR
No crash in sight. Everyone is talking about a crash which means it’s not happing. Be worried when the opposite is happening
Went all in on RIOT @ $62. How fucked am I?

Edit: This is not a rhetorical question
I dont even remember what a green open feels like.
I know at least 7 million of you purchased GME at 12:51 PM thinking it was going to go on a moon mission.
*stock*: falls by .5% intraday

*WSB*: ITS A SHORT LADDER ATTACK ZOMG
Imagine growing up in Bulgarian village, committing financial crime in America, then being questioned by beautiful foot princess as spectator sport.

What a country!
pltr buy dip
are we pamping PLTR with mother Cathie or what?
Fuck I’m using 20k margin and I’m long.  Wish me luck.
Keith should've had the Zoom call inside of a gamestop
Apple just have a Green Day one time you piece of shit
I wanna pivot my entire portfolio into Cathy's firm gilf ass
reading about all this red makes my pussy hurt
I just heard some noise about some hedge fund shorting GameStop, should we all team up fight back against the 1%?!?! 
                                - Posted Via Internet Explorer
A few red days will not make me a gay bear
DFV represented us GME people well! 

Hang in there!
i will continue buying PLTR until i get rich or foreclosed on
I miss the weeks where the market was just a sea of green the entire week and you could park your money anywhere on Monday and retrieve it back on Friday for 10-20% return minimum.

Maybe better luck next week.
I am tired of all this motherfucking red on this motherfucking rocket.
I’m gonna cry tomorrow.
I've noticed there are some very cranky people in WSB today lol. Red days aren't good for their mental health haha.
“You’re still on mute”
I bought calls in AAPL and PLTR that expire in March. I’m over February
Can’t take another red futes
Vlad continues to look like a washed up Kylo Ren
Equally excited and scared for market open tomorrow
*cries* Hey guys PLTR is mooning AH *cries*
Nice dip today. Can we get a stimmy talks going well now pls?
My plan tomorrow: lose money on PLTR some more then buy more
down 10k love that for me
My two biggest positions are PLTR and NIO for my meme portfolio

I’m in pain
Don't have the right words to properly describe how much today has sucked and continues to suck. You wanna talk about overkill.
Everything has been red...all my calls tomorrow may expire OTM and I’m gonna have to live in a cardboard box outside Capitol Hill with my kitten named Mittens begging congressmen to let me suck their dick for shelter, just like the hedge funds. Thanks to the hearing today, I know exactly which congressmen to ask.
Congress be like:

Alexa play Regulate by Warren G.
Not in on PLTR during dip. Feel like I’m being retarded. Is this FOMO or legit
Rep. San Nicholas of Guam did a great job defending retail investors at the hearing today, and raised concerns that almost certainly sent a chill down Vlad's spine: [https://youtu.be/i8hJ9LwGvqU](https://youtu.be/i8hJ9LwGvqU)
I didn't realize I invested in weed to be poor
I hate how Team SoloMid is the first thing that comes to my mind whenever I read TSM. Always takes me a second or two
I know this isn't the WSB way, but the more I trade options, the more I realize that theta gang is the way to go.

Over the last year, the only times I've been significantly profitable is when there's some extraordinary event (like the March crash or the GME fiasco).  The rest of the time my options slowly (and sometimes not so slowly) go to zero.
Buying more APHA
Mr Tenev can you please explain why your haircut is so goddamn weird? I’d like you to only respond with yes or no
Oh god I've become my Aunt. Drinking and watching CSPAN
The Beacons are Lit!

PLTR Calls for aid!

and Cathy will answer!
What comes after a big drop on a roller coaster? 

That's right, a big fucking hill.
Cathie bought more palantir
If Cathie sees value in buying 5 million shares, I certainly see value in buying 500.
# Has anyone seen DFV & Vlad in the same place at the same time before?
I sold most of my arkw to buy pltr today.. then saw they bought 5.2M pltr today. im literally the male cathie
RIOT dumped and b coin didn't RIP RIOT
This sub is bearish as fuck and for the right reasons 

I just hope we are proven to be the ultimate retards again tomorrow and market is blood green
That puke feeling when you lose $8K in one day.

And the worst part is it definitely isn't coming back.
I don't like this market anymore :(

I thought stonks only went up :(
Bought pltr at 29.20. Am I a retard? Please say yes
PLTR APHA
Move tomorrow = tape my butt shut and hide till Monday.
Account went from 115K to 54K this past two weeks. GIVE ME A TEN BAGGER PLZ. 

can't believe i was up every single time and somehow overtraded to lose it all.
Lmao ok I'm ready for my ass to get owned again tomorrow
It's amazing that the rover landed on Mars.  One day I hope humans do colonize it.  A barren rock planet with no natural resources is definitely my number 2 spot behind Earth.

My portfolio absolutely shit the bed today.
Is it time to fire JPow? It shouldn't take this long to replace the damn ink cartridges in the printer.
I’ve seen futures red past 1% and had a huge Green Day the next day, and I’ve seen green futures before a crash. Futures don’t mean shit
I’m in a sticky situation, i am ruined. But i will hang in there
I'm not gonna lie if I open at less than -8k I will consider my self lucky and I can proceed to get drunk in the morning and take a nap.
Gonna be happy tax season is going to be remote this year...

"So $5M of transactions and...8500 net gains"

"Oh I think I'm having connectivity issues...chhhhkkkkkrreeeee"
I'm a planitard and my only regret is not being able to buy more.
We either go to SPY 500 or 300. Make up your mind Mr. Market.
I'm just trying to get back to where I was January 31, this month has sucked for me

Unless you’ve only got weeklies or monthly’s, this’ll be a dip buying opportunity

Yes. It was epic. This and when another member of congress got Vlad to admit that RH had a liquidity problem were some of the highlights of the main hearing.

TITLE: GameStop Congressional Hearings - Part 2TEXT: [Livestream C-SPAN](https://www.c-span.org/event/?508545/robinhood-ceo-reddit-cofounder-testify-gamestop-stock)

[Livestream YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfEuNHVPc_k&ab_channel=FinancialServicesCommittee)5 people.    this dude has 4 lawyers in the room typing him answers

edit: dont usually do this but did this comment get a shout out on cnbc or other?   seems unusual voting
Tldr of the last thread/entire hearing

Vlad: was born in Bulgaria and appreciates all the questions

Plotkins: claims WSB is anti-semitic and hurt his feelings 

Kenneth: has a cool teleprompter and refuses to blink

DFV: is not a cat and likes the stock, so much in fact that he would buy in at the current price

Boomers: can't seem to mute their mic or ask any relevant questions

Edit: Steve Huffman's balls appear to be large

Edit 2: gonna use the printer in Plotkins room for calls on Guam

Edit 3: DFV killing the game out here, one of the few competent people involved in this hearing
Fun fact: if you took a shot of vodka every time Vlad said "very important question" you'd be fucking dead
I SAID, YES OR NO
Notice how DFV and Huffman get straight to the point and everyone else just slowly talks bullshit
u/spez said it himself. The Reddit team combed the comments and could only find ONE instance of an anti-semitic comment directed at Melvin Capital that was downvoted and deleted. This notion that WSB was unified behind these remarks is just plainly untrue and deceitful.
"How many people are in your room Mr. Griffin? (off camera)"

See, I don't think you need any more help.
It’s great Vlad getting lit up but holy shit, open your eyes. They are scapegoating to shit here. 80% going to Vlad. Hedge funds not targeted at all in retrospect. Shorts not mentioned at all. Think about your congressional representation. This is totally fixed.
What a dagger! "How many people are in the room with you?" That's the way to show the difference between retail and the big money.

Edit: [Here's the video link to the question and answer](https://youtu.be/RfEuNHVPc_k?t=11419). (per /u/321dawg)

Edit 2: [Here's a video link to DFV's response to the same question](https://youtu.be/RfEuNHVPc_k?t=16855). (per /u/Nedink)
DFV did far better in this hearing than I was expecting. Truly relieving
A congressman is now on record congratulating DFV for his DIAMOND HANDS
I AM ONCE AGAIN APPRECIATING THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THAT QUESTION
“If a stock has more sellers than buyers does it go up or down?” 

RH CEO: “well umm... thanks for the questions soo yeah uh... robinhood is like... uh a um brokerage... we believe in the democratization of stocks soo... umm.... thanks for the question”
**Tenev just testified that Robinhood has an unconventional pay-for-order flow arrangement.** Answering Rep Joyce Beatty   

>Our model and formula for payment for order flow works a little bit differently. We actually receive payment for order flow as a percentage of the bid-ask spread rather than on a per-share basis. And we do believe that is the most optimal way to structure payment for order flow arrangements.
#your customer is right next to you
#your product is my nephew
OH shiiiiiit "Your customer is sitting right next to you, Citadel"
LMFAO CASTEN ACTUALLY CALLED THEIR HELPLINE INFRONT OF CONGRESS I Can't breathe ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy).
THIS DUDE JUST LIED LMAOOO HE GOT DEADPAN SERIOUS

edit: Ken Griffin just stated that he nor anyone at Citadel has had any contact with anyone at Robinhood in regards to GME during or since this event
#Basically they’re handing the bag to RobinHood and shorts still get to short illegally. Nothing changes.
#REP Tom Emmer is a G for acknowledging DFV is the only one who doesn't have a lawyer in his ear rn
"I AM NOT A CAT"

"I LIKE THE STOCK"

"I WOULD BUY IT, (GME at $45) YES"

-DeepFuckingValue, in Congress, on the record.
"Absolutely not." That'll be a great subtitle for the perjury charge
Are you buying the stock at 45?

Absolutely, Yes.

https://youtu.be/oryD9RTxOMk
I’m confused. Mr. Griffin has 5 people in the room and is obviously reading off of something like a teleprompter.

 *How is that legal?* 

if this was in person he wouldn’t be able to turn to a teleprompter or 5 helpers....
THIS GUAM REP IS FUCKING REKING LIKE NO ONE ELSE
We really watched 5 hours of CSPAN??? 

I’ve become the men I hate.
My take on the hearings today


Griffin - coached and reading from a teleprompter. Lied under oath regarding communication with RH and DTCC

Plotkin- bold faced lied about short positions. 

Vlad- Got steamrolled, whipping boy and probably one room over from Griffin where they beat him with phone books in between sessions. 

DFV - a legend and hero, HE LIKES THE STOCK.
How can these dirty fucks get away with dodging so many critical questions? What kind of clown fiesta are we witnessing?!
Can we appreciate the fact that only u/DeepFuckingValue seems to know how to answer a yes or no question?
Let me....read....this... While.... My friend....
 Finishes.... Typing out..... My thoughts...
If there is anything I’ve taken away from today’s questions, it’s that our representatives are too fucking old and out of touch with the world around them.

That scares the shit out of me.
My favorite part was when representative Anthony Gonzalez (OH) questioned Vlad: 

"So, in your testimony, you mentioned that the estimated deposit requirements from Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC) came in at 5:11 AM Eastern and it showed a $3 billion deficit, correct?"

"I believe that's correct, yes."

"Okay, uh, at that point, 5:11 AM, did you have the liquidity to meet the additional $3 billion deposit requirement?"

"So, uh, as we wrote in detail, uh, on- in my written testimony, there were, uh, there were a series of steps that the Robinhood securities team took to-"

"At that exact moment did you have the liquidity for $3 billion? 5:11 AM?"

"At that moment, uh, we would not have been able to post the $3 billion in collateral."

"Okay, so when you said- and you've said this multiple times- that you did in fact have the liquidity and you didn't have a liquidity problem.. at that moment in time, that is not necessarily true, correct? You had to take steps to get there?"

"Congressman, we did have to- the Robinhood securities team had to work with our relevant clearinghouses to adjust the risk profile of the trading day in order to meet our collateral requirements."

Great, uh, and in order to do that, uh, your choice was to throttle trading- to prevent your clients from being able to purchase in certain shares, correct?"

"That's correct, Robinhood Securities had to restrict buying in about 13 different securities."

"Okay, and if you had not been able to de-risk the profile- portfolio, excuse me- you wouldn't have been able to raise the money, get the bar requirement needed to get the excess capital charge waived to de-risk the portfolio, then DTCC would have stepped in and liquidated the portfolio, correct?"

"Uh, I'm not sure what the exact, congressman, what the exact steps that they would take if we weren't in compliance with the deposit requirements would be, but it would not have been a good situation for the firm or for the customers."

"If a clearing member fails to satisfy a margin call it exposes other clearinghouses members to risk...can put SEC out of compliance. In a case of non-payment, NSCC (National Securities Clearing Corporation) may cease to (...) the clearing member and liquidate its unsettled clearing portfolio. So that, uh, was definitely in the cards. For my constituents, who are Robinhood clients, what would this have done to their portfolio if it had been forced [into] liquidation as a result of missing the capital call?"

"Well, congressman, if it were forced (...) liquidation, at the very least it would have resulted in **a total lack of access to the markets** for your constituents- not just to the 13 securities that we restricted buying in."

"Right, so this would have been an enormous catastrophe for Robinhood, correct?"

...I wish I didn't watch that killcam.
I wanna personally thank Vargas for bringing the conversation back to GME.
DFV called for a break at 420
Every moment DFV doesn’t talk is a waste of daylight.
"that's like taking the 5th"

VARGAS!!!!!!
holy shit Huffman. Inches away from calling out CNBC by name 

&#x200B;

Actually better than TV people talking about the stocks, fuck yea
Main things I learned:

1- Congress people prey a lot

2- If you thank for the question hard enough, you don't have to answer.

3- You can spend 5.5. hours reading scripts on a screen

4- DFV is not a cat

5- Congress ppl need a stimulus check for better internet

6- If you don't want to ask a question but you really have to, save the question for min 4.55
HOLY FUCK HE CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE. 

This dude must fuck only 10s
I admit to the mistake of always improving!!!
DFV is the only one who actually answered the questions, I truly commend him for being our representative.
He brings up the Holocaust comment when it was already debunked? Dafuqqq
reddit ceo actually standing up for us apes feelsgoodman
LITERALLY CALLED THE HOTLINE, THE BALLS ON THIS MAN
Sounds like Vlad really is a fall guy. 90% of all questions have been about RH and Payment for Order Flow.

Virtually none about naked shorts.
Vlad watching his IPO slide down the drain.
My takeaways from this hearing: DFV is not a cat, Robinhood does not in fact have a call center, Vlad doesn’t know or recall any of the things a CEO should know, and Guam should be granted statehood.
Congresswoman: YES OR NO

Vlad: Bulgaria. 

Plotkins: Nazis 

Citadel guy: Maybe if I don't blink they won't know I'm hiding secrets!
[I made it boys ](https://imgur.com/gallery/7ctrQzn)

Adding CNBC Editorial to me resumè
Griffin has 4 people coaching him through this, wow
I gotta say I was especially annoyed by the guy who mentioned that he's proud of Vlad for making himself via the American dream as an immigrant from Bulgaria as if to imply he made himself from nothing. Motherfucker, this asshole's parents worked for the World Bank and he was born with a platinum spoon in his mouth and given the best education and guidance money could buy.
Rep. Nicolas to Vlad, “you halted buys and allowed sells, in order to mitigate capital requirements, and you benefited from that, because it reduced the amount of capital you needed to raise. You took from your customers. You wanted to protect your own position. That is troubling.”
Incredibly impressed by Reddit CEO
You can literally hear one of the 5 people in the room write on a keyboard. And you can see Kenneth Griffin reading from it. 

That's why he talks slow every single sentence. There's no flow.

Edit: [had to make it myself](https://imgur.com/a/8TmC4Kx)
LOL HE ACTUALLY PUT THEIR SUPPORT ON BLAST
Calling the helpline during a congressional hearing is fucking genius
High frequency taxes will apply to zero people in this thread unless you use giant computer systems to trade stocks. If you have access to this kind of technology, why are you hanging out in a livestream mega thread on Reddit?
I love how DFV was given no time yet he used every second with incredible efficiency. Complete opposite of Vlad the Evader. It's like night and day.
# KEY TAKEAWAY TO WHAT GRIFFIN SAID: THEY *CURRENTLY* DO NOT HAVE ANY EMPLOYEE WHO COLLUDED WITH ROBINHOOD. 

# Who have they fired since the incident start or moved to a different org thats not technically under Citadel or did they use a third party?
Reddit’s CEO is incredibly well spoken. He’s clearly a really smart dude
HOLY SHIT THAT CALL TO ROBINHOOD CUST SERVICES
I reclaim the 5 fucking hours
I never really thought much of myself, but guys I really think I could be a congressman after today #inspired
For those who missed it: according to the Robinhood CEO, they closed customer positions to the tune of $3B to cover their own asses, claiming it was for the good of the customers
The DFV exchange with Stephen Lynch was brilliant:

&#x200B;

"I think I owe you some time to speak." - "Well, Ryan Cohen..." - "I RECLAIM MY TIME"
They have 5 legislative days to submit written questions for the panel. 

In all seriousness, if you have a legit question, then I encourage you to email that question to the office of your House Representative. If your Rep wasn’t on the committee, then you can probably email it to your state’s Rep on the committee.

Some thoughts:
1) To Melvin: Did you re-enter into new short positions in GME on or after January 28th?
2) To Citadel: How exactly do you monetize the order flow that you PAY Robinhood to obtain?
3) To Robinhood: Do you currently have the ability to know how many shares your users hold of any given stock in real-time? During the week of January 25th, what was the highest amount of GME shares owned by your users? 
4) To SEC: Why was the uptick rule (Reg SH Rule 201) in effect on January 15th for GME, but not in effect for GME on January 28th and during the week of February 1st?
After watching this all day, my main takeaway is this: I’m so frightened that so many members of the House Financial Services Committee have absolutely no idea how any of this works. It’s truly terrifying.
I also made it on to [CNBC](https://imgur.com/gallery/G8z9G0n) today 

Easier than getting flair in here. As it should be.
“Did any of your colleagues contact robinhood”
“Sir, are you asking me if any of my colleagues had contact with robinhood”
Rep Juan Vargas has them saying they absolutely did NOT stop trading or have collusion and every employee will agree.  Great youve got him on tape NOW SUBPOENA ALL OF THEM
https://i.imgur.com/KmNaVBe.jpg
Shot out to the mods by reddit CEO!
Damn whoever has Anthony Gonzalez as their congressman is lucky. Dude really goes to bat for you guys
Why the fuck is it ok for Robinhood to say they had no liquidity problem without answering the completely obvious followup question: then why couldn't I buy GME????
At the expense of being downvoted, AOC didn't even scratch the surface.
If 36k of us can sit thru this boring ass shit I feel confident that at least 36k are holding this shit no matter what
Today proved beyond reasonable doubt that a substantial portion of congress is too damn old to legislate in the digital age
Vargas with the sneak attack! I’m sorry that one person in 8 million typed a slur, but let me explain why you’re all crooks and how transparent it is that several of my colleagues are in your pocket.

Edit: quotation marks removed. That was my paraphrasing, i.e. I was the speaker for purposes of the quotation marks, and not the actual statements.
GRIFFIN- I have 5 people in this room. Including myself.

VARGAS- 5 people, see they don't need any help.
That's the Grindr notification sound, I recognize that shit anywhere
"People like my nephew aren't the customer, they're the product, your customer is sitting next to you in Citadel"
You fuckin go gurl
Can we please get

I can't believe I watched the whole thing
Rep. San Nicholas of Guam did a great job defending retail investors at the hearing today, and raised concerns that almost certainly sent a chill down Vlad's spine: [https://youtu.be/i8hJ9LwGvqU](https://youtu.be/i8hJ9LwGvqU)
5:07:14

Congresswoman: "What mistakes did you specifically make?" 

Vladdyboy: "Uhhh... I admit that we're always improving"

What a fucking shithead
"please answer yes or no"

Vlad: "Thank you so much for the question congressman. You see, I was born in Bulgaria in 1986...."
We need some much younger representation in Congress. That's my only takeaway.
"We don't have liquidity problems!"

Then why did you restrict trading?

"We didn't have the liquidity needed by the clearinghouse."

So you did have liquidity issues.

"No."

?????
Do you think DFV just casually walked upstairs after this and was like “so what’s for dinner tonight?” Like nothing just happened?
PLEASE TELL ME SOMEONE IS GOING TO MAKE A COMPILATION OF THE BEST HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS CONGRESSIONAL HEARING LMFAO
Huffman and DFV are doing a really good job at representing us reddit folk
WE KNEW THE WHOLE TIME IT WAS A LIQUIDITY ISSUE THANK YOU ANTHONY GONZALEZ
That dude calling the help line was such a power move
Did I accidentally sign up for PH premium? Currently watching a young Bulgarian man get bent over and railed in 1080p
Highlight was when DFV smiled after that guy reclaimed his time because he knew he had legitimate DD
Today was interesting. I watched the whole hearing. A few representatives just wanted to promote their policies, but I did learn a lot. The main thing that came out of it was Robinhood is my least favorite company, and I hope we somehow destroy them when they go public.
I get it that 5 minutes is way too short but this was still over 5 hours. 10 minutes would have been 10+.

The bigger problem is that more than half of the representatives should never have been allowed to participate because of how unprepared they were. Most of them thought the company was called GameStock. Take out these people and you could easily get 10, 15 mins per rep.
This congressional hearing has taught me something. It's time to sell

my house to buy more GME
Does anyone here feel represented? I'm moving to Guam.
This cocksucker had brought shame to my entire home country of Bulgaria. As if we didn’t have enough shit to deal with. Fuck off with this clown.
So apparently after 3 weeks of losing my ass I know more about stocks than the congressional financial services committee?
He is lying, the way he said “Absolutely Not” sounds a bit more like bullshit
Did he just lie to juan vargas' question? Full on denial of pressuring rh to stop buying
Juan Vargas is my gf’s boyfriend
HOLY SHIT /u/spez IS CRUSHING IT!!!!!
They should apologize to DFV for wasting his time today
Anyone else horrified at how little the vast majority of members of the House Committee on Financial Services knows about....Financial Services?
If I had employees as effective as this group I would fire them all.  what a waste! no wonder nothing gets done.  these have been scheduled for weeks now, take a few minutes to prepare for god's sake. 

also, we've been in a pandemic for almost a year now, if you can't figure out how to use zoom, you probably shouldn't be running the damn country.
Bottom line:

It all boils down to Front Running.

The HF and MM and banks all tell the high-worth clients to SHORT a stock BEFORE they put out a public DOWNGRADE.

They all front-run the retail investor. 

It works the other way too (with upgrades). This is why the retail investor always loses (bagholders).

*source: former stockbroker
“I am not a cat.” “In short, I like the stock” all while having a hang in there kitty poster and his red head band displayed .....

Mother fucker, let me have your babies already!
I want someone to ask Plotkin why he kept shorting a $4 stock that had >100% short interest. Yeah maybe the price was higher when he entered the position but surely you monitor risks for any trade? Must have known he was open to risk of a short squeeze. Doesn’t matter if Melvin themselves were specifically naked short or not. Matters that Melvin and other HFs kept their position on even when overall float being >100% short was well known.

They created that position and in turn opened up the short squeeze trade which could have destabilised the market. They’re the stupid ones and retail was smart to jump on their error
Everyone needs to stop and take a moment to remember the one picture on the wall behind DFV.

Hang in there kitty.
THANK YOU VARGAS FOR ACTUALLY STICKING UP FOR US.
I was dying when the Congressman interrupted DFV talking about how GameStop was going to go back up in value, and DFV just smiles cause he pissed the dude off. So good.
Hard pill to swallow.  1000's, if not 10's of thousands, of hard working middle class blatantly robbed of life changing money, earned honestly, legally, done the American way that we've been taught since birth.  This changes the whole game and the life we promise our children.
Vargas seemed like an idiot at first with that apology but rebounded. well done chap
3 hours in and we have learned literally *NOTHING*.

Welcome to American politics.
[deleted]
This is your hourly reminder to close your robinhood account
#Fire alarm beeping because he's bringing the smoke to robinhood
To the congressman browsing during the poop break: please ask about naked shorting. Please ask about collusion between brokers. Please ask about Ken Griffin donating to the committee member’s campaigns.
Why tf isn’t DTCC in this hearing
I’m making this post longer than most, because it covers our fellow retard AOC. Buckle-in, I got as much as I could!

Rep. AOC to Vlad, “you bragged about having competitive rates. This is evidenced by raising requirements. When RH prevented customers from purchasing shares, other brokerages merely adjusted margin requirements. Given RH track record, isn’t the problem you didn’t manage your own book or margin rules or internal risk?”

Vlad, “most brokerages have tiered margin where wealthy customers pay less. Our approach is make a uniform rate so wealthy customers don’t have an advantage. That’s unique.“

AOC, “I reclaim. My colleagues pointed out RH generates revenue from payment for order flow with market makers like Citadel. In 2016 SEC highlighted the conflict of interest. One idea was requiring brokers pass on proceeds from the order flow payments. RH owes customers more than an apology. I agree. Decisions by you and the company has harmed customers. Will you commit to passing on proceeds from payment for order flow to customers?”

Vlad “uh I believe uh in 2015 or 2016 uh”

AOC “I’ll take that as a no. I’m talking about now.”

Vlad, “Um it’s a much larger form of revenue than in the past”

AOC “I don’t wanna be rude but isn’t trading on RH not free, you’re just hiding the costs behind poor execution?”

Vlad, “RH is for-profit and needs to generate revenue. People were skeptical about our model, and I think we’ve proven that otherwise by making this the standard.”

AOC “Plotkin, your testimony was that Melvin had not engaged in a naked short, and Melvin closed out their position. Correct?”

Time expired.
Vlad getting sacrificed, meanwhile Melvin capital, citadel, and dtc are unscathed.
Why oh fucking why do boomers not know how to work a mute button?
#Gamestock; these people are fucking dinosaurs and act like they’ve been briefed 15 minutes prior to this hearing.
This is one of the first times I've watched one of these in full. What a huge waste of time.

No wonder nothing gets done in Washington.

And please learn what the mute button is
How can I short Congress?
Holy fuck did I just spend 5 hours watching this for Melvin to get off scott-free?
WSB is smarter than congress. I put my life on that.
“Please answer in one minute”

Well first I’d like to thank you for that very important question. That question is very important. Let me keep saying bullshit so I don’t have time to answer your question. Oh shoot, looks like we’re out of time
I'm just glad everyone was thanked for their important questions.
We need to trim the fat here.  There so many members of congress involved with this that they only get 5 minutes a piece and it still took 5 hours.  No wonder nothing ever gets done.
Plotkin testified under oath that Melvin Capital covered "all" their short positions. How hard would it be to disprove this if false?
5 hours of foreplay just to be punched in the face while robbed because a goddamn Boomer after 5 straight hours and a year of Zoom still doesn't know how the fucking mute button works.
Vlad was outright hanging there several times. Worst bot ever.

"You admit to mistakes. What mistakes did you make?" - "I....I admit tooo....always improving...we are not going to be public....we are not going to be perfect. We want to improve and not make the mistakes twice..." - "But what were your mistakes?" - "Thank you for the question. It's a very important question. On Thursday we restricted trading..."
CONGRESSWOMAN: YES OR NO!?!?

VLAD: Thank you so much for that important question Congresswoman. I would like to answer your yes or no question by first stating that I'm always improving.

Maxine: Times over bitch. I'll now allow a different person to waste another 5 min. 

Five hours later (Spongebob voice)..................... Well that went nicely.
Congresswoman: So please take this moment to tell me how you personally failed and how Robinhood failed in this situation.

Vlad: I failed because I'm always improving. Every day. Literally every day I'm improving so hard it hurts. Please don't make me pay back the investors I knowingly screwed. Melvin will make me sell my kidney to the Chinese
Every single question: 
Vlad Tenev: Thank you for the question. I think that’s a really important question. I think it’s really important to address this subject. Thank you so much for the question
Loved that he had 0 lawyers, business partners and the like off camera. Unlike the others. Shows his truth right there. He just likes the stock. ![img](emote|wsb_emojis|bull)
I liked when that Congress lady said something along the lines of “no, citadel is your customer - robinhood users are your product”
My big takeaway from today was that there is a human being roaming this earth name Barry Loudermilk.  And true to form, he is an idiot.
SecretLab Gaming Chair: $400

Cat Poster: $16

Red HyperX Mic: $140

Red Bandana: $6.75

Bringing a major hedge fund to its knees with sound investing? Priceless. 

There are some things money can't buy. For everything else, there's ~~Mastercard~~ GME tendies.

I love CNBC's silly segments sometimes lmao. I hope this comment gets featured on air at some point lol as they've started to give shoutouts.
Saying it again, Rep. San Nicolas won the day for me: [https://youtu.be/i8hJ9LwGvqU](https://youtu.be/i8hJ9LwGvqU)
I hate how much they pushed the narrative that people are too dumb to invest and no one told them they could lose money on high risk. 

It’s complete bs. The money was stolen by market manipulation and it was barely mentioned.  It’s like they were more concerned with the terms of service of apps than all the illegal shit they do.
I liked how Citadel fuck head with 4 lawyers in the room couldn't answer that he made a shit ton on his "bottom line" last year while being personally affected by the pandemic with his sunglasses raccoon face tan lines.

I also liked how Melvin straight up said there was less shorts than float and naked short selling "systematically impossible".  Then later on Citadel said naked shorting was possible due to lending shares.  These mother fuckers can't even stick to the same script.
“Thank you congressman, that is a real great question congressman. You sir are a congressman, right? We can agree on the fact that you are a congressman that asked a question. Now let’s talk about that word congressman, which the dictionary defines as a member of Congress, especially a member of the US House of Representatives. Now let’s dig a little deeper into that, by me asking you a question in response to that really important question you asked. What is the US House of Representatives you ask?”
Vlad is a scared little bitch who has no idea what to say or what he’s doing. Trying to cover his ass w a team in the room w him feeding him notes. He came across so fake and sounding so disingenuous. 

What pisses me off the most and no one is specifically bringing up is the biggest fuck up robinhood had was around COMMUNICATION. 

Everyone woke up that morning and found out on their own by trying to trade that they were blocked. The first real communication was a tweet AFTER market open that GameStop buys were restricted. Later that afternoon came a shitty blog post. 

He also lied about the reasons trying to say it wasn’t liquidity problems then saying it was. Vlad and robinhood are lying idiots who don’t know how to handle running a company.

All the had to do was tell everyone AHEAD of time what was going to happen and the truth about why and yeah people would have been pissed but probably wouldn’t be out for Vlads head. 

TLDR: fuck Vlad and robinhood they fucked this up bad
Holy shit. I actually watched the whole 5 hour hearing. They are so fucked. Fucking fucked fucked fucked.  Just some notes vlad lies about notifying people of restricting stocks and letting people know. Citadel gets called out for having Hella lawyers in the room and he's obviously reading of a live teleprompter. Melvin cap and Citadel admit to communicating during all this happening. Then it's completely clear that the good guy hero is DEEPFUCKINGVALUE he answers every question so well and even plays to the audience. I can't wait for episode 2, this is so fucking good I bet Baby Yoda makes an appearance.
The CEO of Reddit said there was only 1 comment and deleted within 5 minutes with 0 upvotes...
Wow Ken Griffin just said the one thing that can put him in jail. Perjury
Hope you apes were taking notes for the next time you get stopped by an “authority figure” 
Officer: “Have you been drinking?”

Ape: “Officer, Thank you for that very relevant question...”

Officer: “YES OR NO?!”

Ape: “Officer, thank you again for asking me that, it’s not a simple question and I am doing my best to get you a very concise answer, you see, I was making my way downtown, walk fast, faces pass and I’m homebound...”

Officer: “my time is up, you are free to leave.”
Juan Vargas coming in with the heat ohhh mama
Vargas asking the real questions here. Who’s feeding you lines like this is a cold call, Kenneth???
Can we cut out the middleman and just put the teleprompter writer  in front of the camera?
IM A BAGHOLDER AND I DONT WANT NO APOLOGY
Wow. Did everyone just ignore Citron making a livestream about shorting GME during the same week as the inauguration?
Don’t blame this guy. The suicided guy was from his state, he’s probably pandering to his constituents.
Still so dead that he called the hotline. Man pulled a Dwight Shrute.

Fucking legend.
Thhhhhaaaaaannnnnkk 

yyyyyyyyyyoooooooouuuuuuu,

 Mmmmmmmmiiiiiiiissssssttrttrreeeeeeeeerrrrrr

 Cooooooooonnnnnnnnnggggggggrrrrrrreeeeeeesssssssssssssmmmmmmmmmmmmmma.......


The clock has expired
1000 times a day? Fuck, no-one tell him how often we were refreshing the GME megathreads when it was peaking.
"ah shit he is answering the question well. Pull the plug!!"
Fucking boomers tripping up AOC wtf
DFV was smart to not say too much especially because he didn’t have a whole legal team sitting in front of him like everyone else did.
I cant believe I watched the whole thing...
I hate how much of an obvious show this is.  They’ve even mentioned 140+% short and the answer was there are already laws to keep us from naked selling.   How is that immediately not considered a confession to breaking said law.   

I hope someone is doing a perjury counter.
Honestly watching this  has given me even less faith in the people actually running this country than I had before.  Which so didn’t think was really possible.  That being said I still like the stock
Citadel, Melvin, and Vlad off to lunch to celebrate
Vlad and HFs got bodied today

DFV is a true American hero. What a fucking ledg
They better not blow it this hard when they have the DTCC there. DTCC are the ones who raised collateral requirements from 3% to 100% the day RH stopped buying. They should be forced to be fully transparent about why they made that decision seeing as they command over $60T (yes, with a T) and thus definitely wouldn't have been facing any kind of liquidity problems. They also probably knew full well what raising that collateral requirement would force RH and other brokers to do. The DTCC is not packed full of saints either, they have been involved in the past in incidents including ones involving naked shorting. They have a direct monetary incentive to participate in shady dealings as they profit from the transactions.
VLAD: You want a yes or no answer eh? Well let me begin my answer by describing the history of Bulgaria, a war torn country. I was born there you know. Thank you congresswoman.
Is it just me, or do 90% of these people say “GameStock”...?
You know, even if the stock goes down to zero I honestly don't even care. I feel so happy to have rode with DFV and the rest of you fuckos shiny and chrome

Edit: spelling.
Yes, Robinhood fucked up. But what about the other brokerages that pulled the same shit? Let’s grill the DTCC. I saw a lot of political theater today and not so much the right questions directed at the right people. Hoping the next hearing is better.
Keith really dropped I AM NOT A CAT on the adults. Crown him.
Just a reminder that Robinhood's original reason for restricting us was to "protect" us.  When it was apparent that that reason wouldn't fly, they quickly backtracked and blamed the clearinghouse.
Robinhood is just a punching bag, the real issue is the DTCC and Melvins 140% short
A few members of Congress accused Robinhood of making the stock market as easy as a video game... But considering how bad most of their zoom skills were, I doubt most of them could even handle Space Cadet 3d Pinball. So how easy is it really?
 

This entire hearing in a nutshell:

Senators: "Tell me, which order fills first??"  
Corrupt hedgefunds: "Well, first let me tell you about my life...."
Guys AOC is going in at the end, please tweet your questions to her, she seems to be reading her Twitter. We need to know about Fail to deliver, short ladder attacks and call logs between HFs and RH
After viewing for a few hours the roles seem clear to me, by the pace of the answers:

Vlad - trying to survive at least until the IPO, on a train to hell

DFV - being protected by almost everyone (and I guess, since he represent the average guy), nothing to hide, clear as clean water

Reddit CEO - biggest balls holder in the zoom

Plotkin - did the biggest shit of his life, career ruined anyway, not so much to hide

Griffin - probably the one who's really hiding the most scary stuff
Rep. Casten with the cell phone customer support call was an incredible flex
Why is DFV the only person involved in all of this that can be concise?
Gonzalez just did what these fuckers should have been doing all day
FINISH HIM JOHNY SINS
"when correctly managed"
HITMAN GONZALEZ. Reppin his constituents
Why the fuck does Guam have better reps than the states. Super jealous
WSB convention in GUAM 2022??
#By RESTRICTING BUYING OPTIONS on $GME and $AMC not just for the day of the 28th but for a WEEK after. It allowed people to only SELL and ONLY allowed the price to go ONE way. DOWN. This only helped one group of people. The shorts.
Man knows stonks, doesn't have time for smoke detectors.
Ok, but how did it get to 140%
How did it get to 140%?

>let me tell you about why institutional short selling is great for your pension

Should we do anything about naked short selling?

>absolutely not

Fuck Citadel
DAMN, PULLING OUT THE LIVE SUPPORT
I feel like im on chat roulette with these random congressmen popping up
I know people wanna hear from dfv but tbh him not having to answer questions is the best possible scenario for him. I hope he keeps every cent

So frustrating, sure Vlad sucks and the RH restrictions cut the GME launch off at the knees but how about someone digs into the fucking details of why RH got put in the position they did. 

Like we know GME was well over 100% short and all we have heard is "Our system won't even allow that, it is impossible" Then how the fuck did we get there?
> Mr. Gill, how many people are in the room with you?

2, myself and Mr. Tenev’s wife
#MAXINE FOR THE LAST TIME MUTE YOUR FUCKING MIC
These questions suck

The most important question is why a hedge fund can short more shares than available.

Aoc was about to ask that but her time got stepped on
Crazy idea: have like 12 people on this committee so they can actually ask real questions.
What a disappointment all around. The best part was DFV saying the line
So I guess the real question is what are we the people going to do about it? It’s obvious that this was all theater but what are we going to then do? Nothing changes if nothing changes. Me, I’m going to get stoned and cry.
Literally nothing about short selling a company 140% what the fuck
Ok, so whats the key takeaway from today?

Citadel + Melvin are going to get a slap on the wrist?

Robinhood being the fall guy (deservedly)

Retail investors get fucked with more legislation + 0 reparations?
Can someone explain to me why it matters why robinhood closed buying on GME? If market manipulation is illegal, and not allowing people to buy GME ended up effecting the market price of GME, why does it matter if what robinhood did was at the behest of hedge funds or if it really was because of the clearing house? Either way it manipulated the market which is illegal, so either way robinhood is at fault no?

Edit: to be clear I am advocating that robinhood should face fines/prison regardless of the “why”. For whatever reason they did it they manipulated the market either way which is illegal
Fucking Elon Musk had better questions for Vlad on Clubhouse than these congress people had. Atleast he talked about the clearing houses
Welp I guess I'll Just buy more GME
Having watched the big tech hearings in their entirety and now the GameStop Congressional hearing in its entirety, these things seem to be invariably massive wastes of time. Just a way for incompetent lawmakers to showboat to their constituents, ask dumb questions, and fail to hold the right people accountable.
The people running our country cant figure out how to mute their mic when its not their turn to talk
What's that Guam guy's username so I can give him gold

Edit: You can email Rep. San Nicolas at gu00.webmail@mail.house.gov
Instead of five minutes per congressperson, try getting the congresspeople that actually know what happened and give them 20 minutes or more for discovery. This was bs, things only started getting deep at five minutes for the few that actually knew what happened
People in some of the top positions in government and the financial sector just got outclassed and outmaneuvered by a guy who is not a cat. 

Thank you, DFV, for representing us so well.
One of you autists needs to calculate how many minutes Vlad wasted with his thank you/appreciate responses
Say yes or no

-I thank you for this very important question. Coming from Bulgaria I often thought to myself,when i was at the beach, looking at birds. Grass sizzling wind blowing. The american dream is so amazing, btw, what was the question? I like birds
disappointed AOC's last question didn't get answered.
Petition to make Griffin sit all alone in the House so we can see how he does without a teleprompter and coaching staff.
Remember when Gabe said that we were a bunch of racists / anti-Semitic - but then Reddit CEO shit on him...saying there were no comments like that. Those were the days
My fellow retards:
Two simple questions. 
1. Why was trading halted for cash purchases of these equities?
2. How many shorts covered position after the halt?

In the most simplest terms: The price of anything is set on supply and demand. If you cut off the supply of something there is no demand. This is why the price tanked.

If those in the political theater can’t figure the basics out we must find another route to change the status quo. I know of only one other way.
The only thing I've gathered from watching this joke was if you ever have to testify in front of congress, just ramble about bullshit for every question instead of actually answering.

Allowing people to ramble on instead of answering questions is pure idiocy. In my opinion anyone who doesn't give a straight answer should be held in contempt of court and assumed the worst possible answer. There need to be consequences for skirting around questions so we don't get the bullshit we see here.

Edit: I believe there should be a 1 year minimum in prison for every single question evaded or unanswered, fines are only a problem for poor people.
Did anyone else notice that when Citadel and Melvin were asked questions they didn’t like they just waited silently until time ran out?
Notice how the RH CEO wouldn’t answer how much profit clients had ACTUALLY made and instead he kept quoting the 35B amount.
If I had a penny for every inch of girth around DFV's package, I wouldn't even need to hold GME
damn i think that hang in there cat poster means that DFV is holding guys.
Vlad “Thank You For That Question” Tenev
I think the SEC should restrict any buying of stocks by any hedge fund party involved with Melvin Capital during the week of January 25, while they’re conducting the investigation. This would include Citadel and Point72 for the Melvin Capital bailout. 

Additionally, the SEC should not allow Citadel Securities to conduct transactions with Robinhood during this time either. 

Talk about a conflict of interest between Citadel Securities and Citadel. How the hell can one entity be involved in both sides of the casino. 

I’m hoping these relationships are the first three dots being connected on the committee’s chalkboard.
I fell like we could have picked a random 50 people off wsb to ask questions and that hearing would have been so much better
# I drank everytime a boomer rep said Gamestock. Send he ggj ytdsjnkl
Its so fucking embarrassing that our country is run by the stupidest people in the country.
Has this video been posted here yet? https://youtu.be/_TPYuIRVfew

Peterffy openly admits the short squeeze was working and was about to push the GME price into the thousands
The most important question was never asked, “Who profited the most from the GME buy halt?”
I just want to point out [the Financial Services Committee YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/FinancialServicesCommittee/videos) has a pretty consistent ~4-5k views per video, up to 25k sometimes. Today's hearing? 543k at just 9 hours after the start of the stream. Iunno. Seems like the retail community may be becoming engaged in not just financial literacy, but even normally boring congressional processes.
For the love of god we needed one question asked today.

Citadel, how many uncovered 1/29 calls were you responsible for by Wednesday evening 1/27? (All calls were ITM)
I have no doubt that there was more than 4 people in Kenneth's room.

Just looking at his eyes, there's 4 TV screens alone that he scans for answers prior to answering anything. You can see him go far left of the camera, far right of the camera, and everywhere in between.

4 Screens = 4 typists.

Probably at least 1 informant per typist.

Certainly at least 1 gopher (likely several) that can fetch information on a whim.

And of course an IT guy to ensure stability.

And if you look in the reflection of the plant, you can see Gabe under the table sucking off Kenneth in between answers.

That room is packed to the tits no doubt.
OH BOY LIED TO THE FACE OF CONGRESS
What you saw today is because your grandma votes and you don't
I like that he didn’t give Vlad the time to give a bullshit sympathy response
Huffman and DFV only two guys speaking the truth under oath
Why those stocks. If you had limited capital wouldn’t you limit all buying then not just on specific stocks
GET HIM, AGENT 47

Love Guam.  Let’s buy this guy a 9 volt battery.
It's not a smoke detector, it's an ass whooping detector.
Make Guam the 51st state!!!!!
Guam just strBEEPaight up murdered Vlad in broad daylight with everyone watching
Can I get the Guam guy to represent my state
Naked shorting is illegal. 140% short.
YES NAKED SHORTING!
"How was it possible to short 140% of a stock?"

Doesn't answer the question and just explains what a short is. C'mon man...
**RH Slave:** Hey boss, how are you today?

**Vlad:** First off, I appreciate the question and thank you very much for asking it. I would appreciate the opportunity to further discuss this some time in the future where we can appropriate more time to the aforementioned question.
#perseverance safely on mars!
Woooooooooo your customers sitting right next to you.

Got dayum
"Your customers sitting right next to you."

I'm moving Iowa after Guam.
4 hours in and there are still 42k viewers on the official financial services committee YouTube stream. That’s insane for a congressional hearing.
Fuck Gabe for making up anti-semitic posts on WSB during his opening statement. 

Huffman called him out and said they only found 1 that was deleted after 5 minutes.
The problem isn't that retail investors were mislead. The problem is that they literally changed the rules by suspending trading to ensure we lost and they won.
OMG. This dude is savage
THE FUCKING PHONE CALL
Bruh this man called the hotline
GOD DAM. HE CALLED THE CUSTOMER SUPPORT
THE PHONE CALL
HOLY SHIT HE FUCKING CALLED THE HELPDESK
Omg did he just call RH support? Jesus
"My nephew isn't your customer, your customer is sitting right next to you" is one of the hardest lines
Can someone please add up all the time wasted by: "thank you for that important question"
I can’t stop laughing at that phone call, holy Jesus
That dude calling the “help” line was the dopest part of this hearing.
Hearing something strange...

His porn was playing in the background
I love the Reddit CEO for defending us through this
**SHORT RECESS AT 4:20**
Vlad got clowned by that customer service phone call lmaoo
I bet DFV called for the recess to buy some more GME in extended-hours.
Robinhood IPO is going to be a disaster
Was just me or the citadel guy just copped out of answering why there were 140% of shares shorted. He never gave an answer and the questioning person just accepted and asked him if they should regulate his industry?! WTF?!
"How many people are with you in the room?" Fuckin loved that question. 

Did they ask vlad too?
Just a heads up to people curious about these questions on addiction and what not:

There are multiple hearings, this question is used to plant the seed that Robinhood _does not_ have the user first in mind as they are exploiting them with these addictive measures. 

Future hearings will exploit this to show they are on the other side of the coin. 

My 0.02 on why this is happening.
The fucking Predator is loose in the room...
Leave it to DVF to be the only one who showed up with an actual mic, internet connection, and knowledge of how to video conference
As a Texan, keep your thoughts and prayers, we want our fucking money.
Mr. Gill lied he’s in the room with my wife
Rep. Emmer, “how many people are in the room with you Mr. Gill? Because others here have five.”

DFV, “zero.”

Emmer, “I want to note Mr. Gill is appearing by himself while others are receiving SIGNIFICANT help.”
Bless this guy for giving DFV a platform
This guy is asking great questions, but his internet is terrible.
Tom Emmer saying retail investers are smart, DFV is genuine, and praising block chain. Really was not expecting any of this from an old politician.
RYAN FUCKEN COHEN BITCH
RYAN COHEN HYPE
DFV is the smartest person on this call atm
When DFV gives that smile it's all over for you.
THE NAME DROP OF RYAN COHEN HAD ME YELLING AT MY SCREEN !!! YESS SIRRR
THAT FUCKING SMIRK. He knows he’s killing it.
\*DFV starts spitting facts and analyses\*

"Whoops, gotta reclaim my time."
Lynch:  I am going to reclaim my time

DFV:  \*Smirks\*

Fucking legend
I love how DFV grins every time someone cuts him off
DFV went in raw on Lynch and he didn’t like it
Gives DFV the floor and gets surprised when he only talks about how good GME is
Lynch: *Oh shit Gill is giving a cohesive and coherent answer.*

Also Lynch: "I'm gonna reclaim my time."
Fucking Stephen Lynch (MA) goes on a long ass rant about all the reasons he thinks GameStop is a shitty company that's worth nothing, then ask DFV why he thinks it's actually worth more than nothing...but then cuts him off when he realizes DFV actually has an answer.

— before trying to say this whole thing is a national security threat.

What a fucking joke.

Seems like every official Massachusetts is paid off by the hedge funds.
We’llberightbackandweareback
Let me make this clear, there was no liquidity problem. Also we didn't have enough money.
Did Melvin just admit that the squeeze hasn’t been squozen
chairwoman slipping bruh give aoc more time for that one
FUCK THAT WAS THE QUESTION WE NEEDED DAMN IT MAXINE
- talks over AOC
- "your time is up"

lol
.... boomer keeps mic live and doesn’t give AOC back her time
This shit had nothing to do with options. This was about a hedge fund shorting a stock 140%, getting blown up on their short, then a broker halting buys on that security because they're sore losers.
Really not loving the way these congresspeople are implying that there should be barriers to who is allowed to trade and deal in options. Regulators should NOT try to step in and say “you’re not smart enough to trade options, so you’re not allowed. Don’t worry, we’re protecting you” fuck that. People need to be free to gamble and loose their money however the fuck they choose. Fuck outta here with your daycare regulation.
We're almost 5 1/2 hours in and AOC getting cut off was the closest we came to a question about naked shorts?
Too much time wasted on vlad and not enough on short sales
I feel like 80% of these questions could've been answered by interns doing some research
These congress boomers didn’t learn shit about all the illegal naked shorting, short ladder attacks, and all the other illegal tactics that the hedgies have used to lower the price of the stock while volume being as low as 8million.
AOC was just getting to the good questions for citadel and her time expired. We want answers!
5 ADDITIONAL DAYS FOR QUESTION FORMULATION 

START CONTACTING YOUR REPRESENTATIVES WITH BETTER QUESTIONS OR SHUT THE FUCK UP
No wonder nothing gets done in congress. I just wasted 5 hours. I want it back.
The only good things that came out of this hearing

-laugh at boomer politicians

-feel a sense of justice when politicians asked questions that are remotely relevant

-DFV is safe(the best thing that came out of this)

When will Ryan Cohen get the respect he deserves?
just realized 5 hours passed...
[deleted]
omg have not seen a single comment about his sister??? fucking feel your roaring kitty <3
Make sure you all file your capital gains taxes this year so Congress can fund more woefully unproductive hearings like this.
"I appreciate the question, but I shit my pants congressman." -Vlad the Impaled
We should have had a drink every time Vlad says, “I appreciate that question”. Fool is stalling...and I would be dead...
So it turns out there is no conspiracy theory we are just governed by fucking fossils that can’t even have a productive conversation through zoom without muting their fucking mic. They needed 5 hours for this wtf
Dfv literally said he would buy now at 45 and that he is still bullish. I love this guy.
Summary:

DFV ftw.
Hold/buy $GME.
Seems like Hedgies won't face any repercussions.
Looks like we pay these people to sit there and collect a check instead of actually working to rep us.
This was a waste of time and could be cut down to a 5 min video.

Summary adjourned *bam*
Those clowns couldn't stop saying gamestock
Vlad's gotta be extremely jealous of the Kenneth Griffin five lawyers + teleprompter set up right?
Vlad, yes or no, do you want me to poke you in the eye with this stick?

Wellllllll,  you see when I was a boy in Bulgaria....
That Citadel Griffen guy stay reading off a teleprompter. Tool. Fuck Vlad.
If these shill congressional members would fuck right off, it wasnt robinhood alone. They gave the rough questions to Vlad and tossed softballs all around. And fuck grandpa with his "oh you're not saying dumb stuff as if people are retarded for buying stocks, Roaring Kitty."
[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0patpmwYbhcEUap0bTX3JQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0patpmwYbhcEUap0bTX3JQ)

Roaring Kitty's YT channel. Let's get him a YouTube award! He's near half a million subs.

He deserves it for getting "I am not a cat" and "Stonk" into the congressional record in a single hearing.
Listen, this is one of the highest forms of government, can’t we not designate 1 single person who’s well versed in technology to facilitate the meeting? Granting mutes/unmutes for attendees? 

The most painful part of today was watching all the boomers struggle to use Skype.
I know now what I am going to say in job interviews if they ask "Name one mistake you made"

I admit to always improving lmao
And all those congressmen just got paid $83+ per hour to sit there and ask their 5 minutes of out-of-touch questions
Rep To Vlad: But why did you not like the stock?

Vlad: Thank you, congressman, that is an excellent question.
So I'm running for congress guys
“first id like to thank you for wasting your five minutes by allowing me, a poor boy from bulgaria, to have an extremely long introduction. you’ve asked a very great question, a very important one. to put it simply, in this essay i will-“
I REALLY hope that people get away from robinhood after this. I transferred to fidelity - and not having charts and colors has me caring less about checking the app frequently giving me instant diamond hands. 
Fuck robinhood.
Haven’t watched a congressional hearing before but oh fuck me sideways, one thing thats alarming is they need to pass a law for is govt representatives to learn to use a fucking computer, it’s bad enough you’re only giving people 5 mins to ask  and respond to questions, worse still, much of that time is spent wasted by audio loopback glitches because you don’t know how to mute your mic. If you’re incapable of even that, you’re wasting everyone’s time even being involved, and obstructing people from getting the facts.
I propose a drinking game....

A shot for every "I appreciate that question"
Thank you chairwoman and members of the committee for this opportunity, first I'd like to start by stating on record, I am not a cat.
1/2 of the representatives not really informed 
1/4 grandstanding 
1/4 not being able to operate computers
Put this in a reply but I hated AOC's second question. If Robinhood is doing commission free trading and everyone wants improved customer service they have to generate money from somewhere.  Asking for kickbacks is stupid and it took away time from her much more important third question.
So nobody talked about how way more shares are still owned than exist? Lol
I haven’t seen anything antisemittic on here btw
I'd like to mention DFV has a longer WiKi page than Vlad.

If i can ask for anything this month, it's to give our logo a red bandana. At least just for the month. Our hero must be honored.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith\_Gill\_(investor)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Gill_(investor))
Got a question. 
Plotkin said the daily volume around 28/29 was around 11x the short interest and any shorts would have had no trouble closing. 

I don’t believe this is the case. I think they would have had trouble closing as there were not enough free shares. You can’t equate volume of transactions to shares available to buy.

I think it was a straight out lie; that misrepresented the truth, in a congressional hearing. And I wish someone had caught it...
Why is Demetri Martin testifying on behalf of Robinhood?  It's not even that funny, even with all the awkward timewasting...
The whole process is a joke... 5 minutes and you're done.. How do you expect to get anything done? Cut the amount of people asking questions ffs and get some real meat on the bones..such a shit show
What if Elon just tweets the hang in their kitty pic
Kenny had  the biggest "oh shit" look on his face when Juan Vargas threatened the deposition hahaha

Citadel employees will be in for a nice bonus this year I take it.
To be honest, Vlad is exactly how I would imagine the CEO of Robinhood to look like.
“I am not a cat.” “In short, I like the stock”.....

Damn mother fucker, let me have your babies already
They finally did it, they launched a GameStop-logo t-shirt https://www.gamestop.com/clothing/mens/clothing/tops-shirts/products/gamestop-logo-t-shirt/11116355.html?dwvar_11116355_color=black

This is the only thing I'm wearing in 2021.

2500 shares; 4 shirts; diamond hands on both
why weren't the CEOs of all the other fee-less brokerages part of this hearing i don't understand why it was just specifically robinhood's
CC companies bombard us with apps the day we turn 18 but lawmakers want to make it harder for us to invest...
It’s so obvious that Vlad should not be the CEO of robbinhood and does not have what it takes to be the guy in this moment of time. He fumbled through this entire thing
Plotkin actually says he doesn't even think the short cover moved the stock.

Melvin says the squeeze has not been squoze?
Anyone have a clip of the congressman who called RH help center?
I really wish someone asked why they needed to restrict GME and others for "liquidity problems" yet were able to magically find 3ish billion dollars within 24-48 hours
I’m catching up on today’s hearing. Did anyone else notice that the guy from melvins office looks completely empty? Lmfao
Can’t believe they didn’t ask the Melvin dude about the bailout or possible collusion with other hedge funds. He clearly put that in his statement because he was so defensive.
All these congresspeople talking about educating retail traders don’t realize that it was a good trade. The only reason it failed prematurely is the Robinhood fiasco. It’s not an issue on the side of the retail traders at all
Just want to say thanks to Reddit CEO Steve for standing up for us and saying Reddit users are “exceptionally good” at sniffing out misinformation on  the site and that investment advice on Reddit is “probably  among the best because it has to be accepted by many thousands of  people” before getting visibility.
That phone call was RUTHLESS
#So we’re just going to ignore the fact that RobinHood and other brokerage firms coordinated with Citadel and Melvin Capital and other hedge funds to completely STOP the ability to PURCHASE $GME and $AMC and artificially DRIVE the price down by ONLY allowing retail investors to sell while those same hedge funds could PURCHASE those same stocks and focus on: “stonks hard we need to protect the consoomer.”
Unpopular Opinion: but Mr. Steve Huffman of Reddit absolutely killed it.

Didn't trip over his answers, offered nothing but facts, and remained very neutral throughout.

Great representation of our community!

edit: ok, not as unpopular as I thought.
Juan Vargas is a national treasure.
Dude just nuked him with his own call platform
Every time someone has said "let me be perfectly clear..." has lied
Can we add "if you wanted to filibuster, you should've run for the Senate" as an automod response? Maybe to particularly long comments?
AOC and the female rep 2 turns before her had absolutely paramount questions not be answered, or “talked around” due to the time constraint and absolute bull shit coming from Tenev and Citadel. Shameful. It’s so shameful.
One thing is clear. DFV was the smartest person to speak today.
The mere fact that one of these elected officials had a shelf with VHS’ on it in the background is enough to really push for term limits.
Y’all remember when Vlad told CNBC it wasn’t a liquidity issue only to say today that it was indeed a liquidity issue
Huffman is extremely professional. I like this guy
Lady, they stayed up until 4 in the morning so the could play video games and smoke weed...not to buy stocks
Wait isn’t it 4:20
5 min break at 4:20. Coincidence...I think not!
I want to see dfv check his magic 8 ball to answer a question.
anyone else hear the pirring sound?  Was DFV lying?  IS HE A CAT?
DFV really getting into his stride now! Got these bitches backing up!
DFV's smirks are the best
Did Plotkin just admit that the short squeeze still has not occurred, and that it was only a gamma squeeze that caused the rise???
"Yes or NO"  


"SO I was born in 1955, 463 years after Columbus discovered the American New World you see"
They're still shorting the fuck out of GME. There's no way that many people, if any at all, are selling. It would have plummeted already. Same with AMC.
#Bullshit you imposed the restrictions mid trading day. No notifications. I was able to buy $GME and $AMC and suddenly I wasn’t allowed to buy them.
"we're not gonna be public"

Lol Freudian slip

ARE U FUCKING KIDDING ME THEY REALLY LET AUDIO BUGS CUT HER TIME DOWN TO LIKE 3 MINUTES
PLEASE check on anyone who decided to make a drinking game out of 'thank you, I appreciate this question.' Pretty sure they may be dead now.
What is the point of congressional hearing if you only get 5 minutes where the witness just wastes it with “thank you for your very awesome amazing informative great question”

Edit: spelling
That dude tried the anti Semitic card after Reddit ceo already slapped the first dude with facts.  Sad little man
holy shit the prompter reading is absolutely cringey and obvious.
Vargas you goddamn savage
Vlad's hairdresser is the real criminal in all of this.
Gottheimer: "Do you see any difference between /r/WallStreetBets and a murder-burglar breaking in to your home and stealing your precious gems and raiding your porn stash and kicking your dog?"

I mean.....
Damn huffman and DFV killing it with their short air time
u/spez holding up brilliantly, telling the congressman to fuck the fuck off in a nice way.
These congress fucks really think our subreddit can't decipher between real DD and bot-generated bullshit.
DFV as a Diamond Hands Hero is in the congressional record for all time now.
Kenneth Griffin looks so fucking ridiculous watching his wife’s boyfriend’s ORDER FLOWING into his wife while barely answering
Rep. Gonzalez “did you have the liquidity to meet requirements at 5:11 AM when asked?”

Vlad, “no.”

Gonzalez, “so when you said you did, that wasn’t true.”

Gonzalez catching Vlad in a lie is my new fetish
Whoever told Vlad to stop appreciating questions is the real hero
Gonzalez always does his homework. Very understated but always a hard hitter on the Committee
VLAD IS ADMITTING THEY WOULD HAVE GONE BANKRUPT
Bro change your fire alarm batteries lmao
Holy fuck he's killing him! "You took from your customers in order to minimize the 3billion... in order to protect your position"
Hey he said bagholder! That’s me :D hi mom I made it.
Just realized that this format allows the witnesses to get coaching for answers. In person testimony doesn’t.
Thats not even the last thread that's 100% the whole congressional hearing so far
Or a [sip of beer](https://imgur.com/a/yBM3wWh). I think Reddit’s CEO is already playing.
Let me start from the beginning, when I was a boy in Bulgaria...

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
Congress seems taken aback when they ask for a yes or no and get a yes or no.
Seems kind of anti semetic to go straight to Jews when money is involved.
I just want to give a shoutout to u/zjz as theres a high likelihood its his/her army of robots that filtered the racist and anti semitic crap that gets spouted by actual fucktards that most likely not native to WSB.

We are retarded but we aint anti-semites. Hell we dont even hate our wife's boyfriend(s). 

The only thing we hate is ourselves and our retarded plays.

Big props to u/zjz and welcome back!
69 lawyers
Someone needs to make a highlight reel quick for those of us who missed it
Yep, RH is the scape goat. People know RH. They don't know Citadel or Melvin, and they sure as shit don't know how clearing, settlement, or collateral works, and they have never heard of the DTC.
He burned him dude. That was so far the highlight of today. I think its tied with that random ass wtf call out
Wish he woulda if asked Mr Gill too. “Uhhh just my lawyer... my daughter and wife are up stairs. I’m in my basement.”

Edit: doesn’t even need his lawyer there.
He’s the only guy actually answering questions
It’s easy to answer questions when you haven’t done anything wrong and can just be straightforward. 

Lying and beating around the bush takes practice.
Amazing. Between him and the "thats some Deep ... Value" quotes you really get a feel for who gets it, or at least with it enough to talk to a young intern who does.
Thank you retard u/TheBliTzzzzzz for this comment I appreciate this comment

No further statement because I am now out of time and thank you again for the comment
Congress:

Seems fair.
The gentleman's time has expired
No body knows what it means but it's provocative
That lady was very mad that her nephew liked the stock
That hit hard
KenG’s brain: “fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck i hope theyre bluffing and dont depose everyone at citadel.”
"I did not have relations with Vlad"
He thought he was going to get a gotcha in. Roaring Kitty wasn't having any of that shit.
The fucking smirk. What a god.
What a guy. Answered so clearly and honestly the rep couldn't even respond and only laughed.
I love that he has the headband hung up on display behind him. A solid statement with the message: I obviously cannot wear this while testifying, but nothing has changed. He has nothing to hide. Representation of how he fought to get where he is and is not changing his outlook because he is now "in trouble". He did nothing wrong and is confident in his answers. Nerves of steel in that situation.
How can it be someone's sworn testimony when it's someone else's words? Congress needs to have some balls and put their foot down.
First time watching a congressional hearing hun?
The country is run by literal zombies.  80 year olds dude.
Thats why Mark Cuban said to switch to a platform with trillions in assets.
Vlad admitted to lying on record here. Hope he goes to prison for perjury
That was a brilliant move. Put Vlad in Check.
That’s because DFV did nothing wrong. The other guys, did something wrong hence why they will not address questions directly.
That's one of the best parts. All these other idiots dance around answering a question, and DFV is just like "Correct".
His script wasn't updated in time.
Bro, even if they had 500 guys colluding, they'd lie. They don't have to tell the truth at all. There's zero accountability
I was like "yo fuck this guy- OH SHIIIIIIT GLOVES ARE OFF"

Had us in the first half, not gonna lie
*With his headband hung on the corner fucking legend*
Melvin posted that comment so he could say it IMO
Drinks on me, apparently
Good bot
Lmao, that intro had me dying
Had to say yes 3 times when asked if he'd buy at 45 lol
That doesn’t happen in their world. You can tell the difference between real people and corporate/government people very easily. Real people answer questions.
Freudian slip level 10
Also RH is the smallest guy in the room; RH<Citadel<DTCC

Guess which are getting the most flack
The highlight for me was the lady who said "woah, let me be clear. My nephew is not your customer. He's your product. Your customer is sitting next to you." 

I literally screamed when she called him out like that.
"My daughter, my wife, and my wifes boyfriend"
He just said "zero (other people)"
Yeah, many weren't thrilled about him having to be part of this, but I figured he'd actually just answer questions straight up while these other idiots filibustered their time and make WSB more believable as DFV didn't dance around answering questions. Which is absolutely what happened here; was DFV in a debate with Presidential Nominee's.
This + one million vote.
I think he might be another one of those Zuckerberg lizard people.
Well he just got asked for that info so I'm sure he's shitting himself now
You know he wanted to say the thing
And asked him "yes or no" even though he had just responded Yes.
Lol them calling them out somewhat for being evasive is more than they usually do to other politicians
Holly shit u/zjz your bots are on fucking point
Because they think we are fucking stupid
If you've been coached you'd be told to never give a one word answer. Always draw out your answers as long as possible to eat up as much time as possible so less questions can be asked within the 5 minute window.
It’s because he’s not trying to hide anything. The rest of them are to varying extents.

Edit: Huffman perhaps not so much as the others.
Nice to see them cut to the point a little for once, but we both know it still won't go any further than some strongly worded letters.  It's still *congress* we're talking about lol
And it helps to stay away from definitive conclusions. 

If you said “I believe that’s correct based on my recollection of the situation.” As opposed to “yes” you can walk that shit back easily sonnnnn!
TITLE: DFV’s smile, he’s watching all us apes support him.TEXT: DFV is better spoken with more conviction than any of these witnesses on the panel.
The reason he is seemingly so confident and composed while **legitimately answering** and not just skirting around the questions he is being asked, is because he is the only one in this hearing that isn’t isn’t lying and trying to brush it all under the rug and/or regurgitating something he’s been told to say.
I'm not a cat. I just like the stock.

#DeepFuckingLegend
He’s so cool
This smirk happened after he got cutoff by his own rep.
Watching his own representative interrupt him was disheartening (he was giving a great answer, just not the "right" one).

These people forget who works for who.
u/DeepFuckingValue

I love you
Yeah the rep did not like DFV’s answer so cut him off, because DFV was speaking truth, and called on someone else.
*He is not a cat*
House committee on one monitor, wsb on the other
“Mr. Gill, how many people are in the room with you?” DFV: “Zero”.
If nothing else, having DFV on the witness stand today exposed the **absolute fuckery and dishonesty of our financial institutions** and that they are willing to do whatever it takes to keep their edge. This changes nothing for why we bought the stock to begin with and my stance to HODL along with Mr. Gill.
How does he keep a straight face with WSB open on his second screen? With just a fraction of what I've read since hearing started I'd have been on the floor in the middle of a question, or at least started responding, "That's a good question, Thank you for the question. My name is Vlad."
This guy fucks my wife.
Secret Lab better sponsor him for this free advertising
Dude has a 100% clear conscience.  My hero.
Govt: Mr. Gill, here's your gag order. No more posting your positions on reddit. 

DFV: Does hanging a poster of a cat holding on count?

Govt: what???

DFV: I'm not a cat.

Govt: Ok, no problem.
I just like the stonk
He was the only one who actually answered the fucking questions! Everyone else was just thanking everyone for asking them a question and then proceeding to tell a story all about how my life got flip turned upside down
Would you buy the stock now? For me personally yes!
Fucking legend
It's because he knows the majority of these representatives have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. It's a bit concerning.
He's not a cat. DFV is the fucking GOAT!
Not gonna lie when he mentioned his sisters passing it got me emotional. What a down to earth dude
He knows he's owning the day.  A true God
What are the chances he’s not wearing pants.
Congressperson: “Now, Mr. Value .  . . .”
DFV: “Please, please, Mr. Value was my father. Call me Deep Fucking.”
Can you just imagine what a crazy story he is gonna be able to tell his kids and grandkids?! Wow!!!
Hang in there
Oh that smile. Grinning like a Cheshire cat!
And of course the second best moment of the whole thing "Mr.Gil how many people are in the room with you"
DFV: none

As opposed to a full on legal/pr team behind everyone elses cameras
If DFV and WSB isn’t in future finance textbooks and history textbooks I’ll be pissed.
Vlad is such a robot. The whole panel threw him under the bus.
I have to be honest. I didn't know much about DFV prior to this hearing. But after hearing his story and seeing what a kind down to earth guy he is, I'm a fucking fan. I can't think of anyone more deserving on this sub to win the bet of a lifetime. Most other witnesses today lied through their teeth with corpo speak. Most of the politicians asking questions just wanted to grandstand. But DFV didn't come for the attention, he didn't come to gloat or condemn anymore. My man just liked the stock. I'm proud to declare him a patron saint of all us WSB retards. Godspeed DFV. Enjoy those earned tendies.
I smiled every time he was shown. Then he smiled back!
He’s not a cat,

He likes the stock, and

#HE’S STILL IN
The tie is the funniest thing, he should have worn it as a head band, animal style.
He was definitely on Twitch lol
Pretty sure that was the smile right after Representative Douchbag cut him off because he didn't like the truth DFV was spitting.
He has the best, most accurate and smart answers and he knows it! And its just him!
The guys that are writting Griffin's lines are being replaced every time it's Griffin turn to speak, they are fkn breaking their hands writing the answers in 0,1 sec
He should have worn one of those t-shirts that look like a tux.
DFV makes us very proud
I like the fact news anchors are even calling him by his screen (roaring kitty).
If my wife doesn’t fuck him I will.
Secret Labs owes this man a free chair.
I will hang this shit above my bed and pray to him every single night
He was definitely the most relaxed person there. Why? Because he invested legally in a stonk THAT HE LIKES
I like the stock
I am a bit disappointed he hasn’t gone more into some of the short interest and manipulation on the stock or atleast his opinion when given the opportunity earlier. I guess he being cautious to not put to much attention and heat on him.
So just to be clear, one dude who says "hey everyone, buy this stock" is illegal and evil, but senators using inside information and selling all their stock the day before covid pandemic is declared is ok?
what a bunch of shit. The Rep from MA just read the question he was provided by WS, and then cut off the answer, cause he clearly doesn't care.
He's got a Jimmy McGill vibe goin on here.
The background made this. This what we need more of during these hearings someone who completely trolls while also being serious.
Love you /u/deepfuckingvalue
They did not ask him too many questions, so he could be just checking reddit, or sleeping with Melvin Capital's wives.
I DIDNT KNOW DFV AND SPEC WHERE SO HOT
Now that’s a proper fucking haircut. Take notes Vlad...this is how to not look terrible
Thank you u/deepfuckingvalue and u/spez amazing work representing the free world today
Someone just brought him a tendie snackie.
I can't even believe the amount of times the Congresspeople said "Gamestock"

Funniest day since before Covid I think lol.  DFV for pres!
For real, u/DeepFuckingValue you were inspiring today.

Also, sorry to hear about the passing of your sister. My heart goes out to you and I’m sure she’d be very proud
The best additional part to this is when he was asked how many other people he had in the room with him, and he said 0 lol

Let’s let that sink in, this fine young man was in the house presumably with at least his wife who was keeping it down because he had to go to a government hearing 

HAHAHHAHA. Love it. Keith - YOU THE MAN!
Do you think he’s wearing pants?
That poster and headband.  Nice touch.
I'm going to go out on a limb and say: DFV is the first American ever to testify before Congress from a gaming chair.
what a god
That subtle “hang in there” poster in the background telling us to keep our hands diamond!
he did well. good ape
Of course he has that bandana in the background
honestly we should be more thankful for him. he is our voice.

DFV is so much of what is page stands for and I think we are SSSSOOOO LUCKKYY that HE (could have been a retard like me) is a small image of who retail is.
Hang in there!
The real Robinhood
“I’M NOT A CAT”
Love the Hang in there purposely put in the background
Human beings surprise the shit out of me sometimes. He could've been any one of us. He's so damn far above the CEOs staring wide eyed at prompters and high paid assistant's telling them what to say. He just sat there comfortably, told the easy truth, and made them all look like complete jackasses as they dodged questions.
One of my favorite parts when drilling the hedgies.... "How many people there in the room with you?"  "Five." "Five!? You don't need any help."
With his fucking ninja headband hanging on it. So fucking deep

* Edited nina to ninja ....
It’s because he’s not lying through his teeth.
Like everyone is saying, it’s easier to tell the truth than it is to lie. That distinction has never been clearer than in today’s hearing. Look how hard it was for Vlad, Gabe and Ken to dance around the questions. Compare that to smooth talkin Gill’s responses.

E: Misspelled God’s last name
I can see him getting a TV show in the future .  

Tonight After Mad Money I’m not a cat with DFV.  Rated M for mature
And has a better mic. All the CEO's have high level audio/video equipment and then the congresspeople come in with the built in mic of their 150$ chromebook
The reddit ceo was also well spoken
It’s because he speaks facts and from the heart, not a teleprompter script
The truth is like a cat. You don't have to defend it. Let it loose. It will defend itself.
also he doesn't have a team of lawyers feeding him answer
Its super easy to speak with conviction when your core values remain consistent and truth is on your side.
Uh yes, thanks mr. congressman for the chance to answer such a great question...every freaking time...Vlad was so freaking cringe with that bullshit. 

I am a little disappointed that he wasn’t wearing the red glasses and bandanna. I mean, I get it, but that would have been epic AF. And we he said mainly I just like the stock...loved it. 

And I’ll. E the first to admit that I don’t care for spez...like at all, but he did right by WSB and put crybaby Plotkin in his place after he tried to basically say that this was somehow related to antiemetic, alt right, white nationalism buzzwords. That shit was funny.
That was probably my favorite part of the entire hearing.  How many people are in the room with you right now?
Agreed.  All the other answers seemed very scripted.  Because they’re the ones that have done some lawsuit worthy shit.  If I was the real Papa Elon Musk, I’d give him a free Tesla.
[deleted]
I know it’s been talked about all day already, but how funny is it that he has the cat picture & *fuckin headband* hanging in the background
DFV and Reddit CEO both did really well and answered questions to the point.
The beautiful thing is Citadel, Rohinhood, and Melvin all tried to blame each other. On the flip side retail investors stood behind DFV and did not betray each other. What a den of vipers.
"I would like to be the first to acknowledge that investing in stonks and options are incredibly risky...." "Folks should be able to freely express their views on a stonk and they should be able to buy or not buy a stonk based on those views they have" https://youtu.be/RfEuNHVPc_k go to the 4hour 41 min mark. Pure gold.
I was so pleased he slipped those in!!!! "I am not a cat," "I like the stock," and "Cheers everybody!"
His chair says Secret Lab.......
anyone got a time stamp for "I'm not a cat"? i wanna save it lmao
I actually lol'ed when he said those phrases and yet he was able to keep a straight face throughout. Nice.
God I wish someone half that cool could plow my wife
in addition to that, he really is a very nice person too!
Yeah, he thought he was catching DFV out somehow and cut him off as soon as he realised he was giving such a solid, clear and concise "wrong" answer.
Do you have a source for this? I was in class and missed it.
lol you know DFV had the chat open too so i bet he knew we'd all get a kick out of that
His own rep opened with, "I more than anyone should give you time to respond".. Then proceeded to chew up a large portion of time with exposition....

And then interrupted him and changed questioning lines and targets..
As someone who resides in MA , I can tell you it wasn’t surprising his rep did that, most of the politicians don’t care much for the common people especially that guy.
His Rep sounded like a douche to be honest.

I didn't check but my best guess is that he has a lot of big WS campaign contributions
Damn straight. Also can you link?

Edit: Also, ngl, I sometimes fantasize about being in one of these hearings just to smack down these toadies. "_Excuse me_ Congressman, I wasn't quite done with that answer. If you could just wait 10 seconds..."
To be fair, the answer that the representative was after was the one I also would have liked. But DFV played it safe for obvious reasons - he doesn't want to push the short squeeze narrative, seeing as he's being sued.  


Completely understandable.
Haha yea I think this screenstill is actually from that response. I think this was when he was asked if he would still buy GME at it's current price he actually started going over his analysis and basically upselling GME to the audience before being cut off by the congressman who asked the question. It was fucking brilliant
>These people forget who works for who.

No one in congress or the senate can claim to work for us. The have and will continue to work for themselves first, last, and always.
In short, I like the stock.

Could you share a video of that part? I was in class nd missed that part.
Seriously. His rep was suggesting that there is some inherent value to companies that isn’t based off of total fucking subjectivity. The stock market is 100% subjective. So fuck that guy. u/DeepFuckingValue deserved better than that.
JFC that’s bad... His own rep too.
I am not a cat.

That's totally how it looked like. He was looking away from his monitor time to time.
“A number not greater than zero” - the best lawyers
I am under the impression that he has some extensive DD that he would have loved to share regard the short positions but since his lawyer told him to be quit, he has to subliminal message us about it.

Absolutely.  

I’ll tell you what.  I came to really appreciate that some (obviously not all) congressmen really stood up to the institutions and rallied behind their people. (And yes I get it, they’re voted in and count on making the people happy) but I could tell the difference between the ones placating and the ones who were really standing up for the retailers.
This reminds me of when congress had the baseball players appear. They had fuckall idea what was going on so they called people to the principals office for questions.
He is his own wife’s boyfriend
Who doesn’t guy
That's how he got his warranty extension.

"9 out of 10 asses prefer secret lab for enduring bullshit"

Halp
I have no doubt that was planned and he is; he doesn't do anything that is not calculated. 
Hang in there.
A lot of the representatives had good questions or clarified important points in my eyes. 

Specifically Gonzalez from Ohio clarifying what would have happened if robinhood couldn’t have paid up.
I think all of the witnesses took great care in which background they chose. Notice Melvin guy chose the shitty empty office to make him look humble with that lonely printer and beat up desk in the background. You know that’s not his actual office.
My guy really put that headband on top of the “hang in there” poster. Now I’m not trying to get into conspiracy theories but between DFVs tweets, RC following and shortly unfollowing DFV and then following Elon, Vanguard’s stay the course tweet, and now this. Maybe it’s confirmation bias here but I’m not going to lie it feels like these guys are saying to hold and believe in the company.
No shit
He did mention he still has his position on gme. IF HES STILL IN, IM STILL IN.
You’re at 69 upvotes... I won’t fuck that up for you.
Reminds me of the reps trying to make tech laws (or lack thereof). Most have no idea what they’re talking about, lol.
This. Maxine waters is a fuckin idiot. And not the kind of idiots we are. These reps are so old and disconnected/uneducated on things it’s pathetic.

He could run for president and have about 9M votes in the bag already. That's a good start!
Did someone actually ask him that? I watched most of it, but was working so I missed some things.
Did he actually say that?
He said it himself, he is not a cat.
I like that the red headband is just chilling in the background.
Was very very obvious. That’s why I hate the covid virtual hearings. These assholes don’t deserve that kind of leeway.
that's because they can't say deepfuckingvalue!
I hope he countersues and wins bazillions more! LOL
He was never in it for the short squeeze position. Man is all on board with the fundamentals, and its why its so infuriating for the folks trying to pin this on him. I read gmedd and his thesis and got in around 40 and still believe in the company at 80-160 as well, especially under Cohen. Doesn't mean I didnt sell some on the way up and the way down and I still have 50 shares to hold long.
In short, I like the stock.

Exactly...it’s hard to lie. It’s easy to tell the truth.

Edit: thanks for the award!! My first!! And second!! And third!! Thank you!!

Wow-thanks everyone!! Please don’t spend money on these awards, only free ones! Use your money to buy more GME!!!
Judge Judy: if it doesn't make sense then it's not true!
"Thank you for that very important question" while your lawyers furiously type out a response on your teleprompter.
Yeah, don't forget, Ken bought his politicians. Thars how he can lie and get away with it.

He was the fifth largest Political donor in 2020 in the country. 

You can tell by the ones who treat him with the kid gloves, and actually praise him.
You misspelled “Gill being the only one of them actually physically capable of answering yes or no questions consistently”
True, but I’ve tripped on my words after being asked when my birthday is.
All the others dude have something to lose. Gill doesn't. He didn't do anything wrong. It's ridiculous and bullshit that they even want him there. He did great.
I would actually be rated r for retarded
Rated M for meow.
I definitely see someone trying to make a movie based on this story
He should get a high paying corporate job at GME for having conviction in their future! Make his salary 100% stock options, lol.
He’s a cool cat
Chromebooks are great... just not for teleconferencing.
His testimony was great.

"Do you require users to confirm their identity?"  
"Anonymity is the entire point. We're not going to decide for them what to disclose."

"But what about bots and other malicious actors trying to manipulate the market?"  
"Look, they're retarded, they're not fucking stupid."
He probably likes the stock.
I thought DFV WAS the reddit CEO.
fuck spez
Wow it sure does. Thank you stranger!
My favorite part was the “hang in there” kitty poster with his headband hanging off of it, he’s a king just memeing at a Congressional hearing
I was surprised that was the end of it though
 I expected a much harsher follow up on clearly being fed what to say on the stand. I had no idea that was allowed
Ken Griffin's eyes at some points looked as though they were reading something very high up in the room. Talking points literally stacked to the roof.
Huhh?..?

Zerooo
Anyone got a timestamp for this? I need to see it myself
All the others have a team of lawyers off camera coaching them on what not to say. DFV is just there, by himself, telling the truth.

It’s a beautiful thing to watch.
They were scripted. Some of them were literally reading things as others were typing them. Hell some of them had up to five other people in the room.
They have to provide written testimony beforehand so even DFV was reading for this part. The difference is DFV wrote his own testimony.
Can't stop. Won't stop. Game Stonk.
OMG I wasn't sure that's what he said when I saw it but I definitely thought it. He totally did put so many subliminal messages in his testimonies.
He really introduced himself with the I am not a cat line lol
Hmm, I looked at 4hr 19min - are you sure that’s the right time stamp? I wanna see this GOLD.
Same. Have to admit, I am praying he gets in a tendies reference in the coming days.
Part way down. Game of Thrones special edition. Still not as disappointing as Congress ...

Wait, his representative in Congress was able to cut him off? They called him for a reason. Let the man speak.
Someone linked it above so I copied it, hopefully the time stamp is intact

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfEuNHVPc_k&ab_channel=FinancialServicesCommittee&t=17184s
It was funny.  The representative for his district was streaming from his huge wood paneled library in what must be a $2m house.
Right, like Taxachusetts gives a fuck about any of us small normal folk
Yup, I don't really know who he is but the way he framed the question was like he was hoping to set up DFV for a quote he can use later. And when that didn't happen and DFV was about to go on with some logic, he quickly reclaimed his time and moved on. 

Dude was not there to help!
Was a straight up sociopath. Acted like a buddy saying he of all people should give him time, and would. Then asked a 4 minute question, interrupted the answer, complained about getting time back, then yielded his remaining time at the end. 

That guy has killed puppies, I'm sure of it.
Here is the dude's testimony:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfEuNHVPc_k&ab_channel=FinancialServicesCommittee&t=17184s
They'd just yell over us and 'claim their time back' - as fun as it would be, anyone who did this would be avoided and never asked a question again, since you won't let them get their soundbite and grandstanding in.
Bruh tlida did just that it was like 5 mins of non stop the American people are done bailing you out.
Except DFV isn't in GME for the squeeze, is what he's always said, and that's one reason he hasn't sold the bulk of his position. The rep was droning on about GME being a strip mall retailer not worth anything and he wanted DFV to admit that, and there is no reality in which that would happen, because it's not what DFV believes. So when DFV started giving reasons why the stock is worth more than he initially anticipated - and good reasons - he got cut off. He wasn't serving the reps purpose
Yes or no
Thank you for this beauty u/zjz
Good bot
Sure mate. I’m on mobile, scrub vid to [4:46:50](https://youtube.com/watch?v=shrkw-dV9S0&feature=share). This is when the rep starts questioning DFV.
That was really crazy. Very rude of the rep. Yet after taking 3 full minutes to ask his question and trying to crack a few jokes about landing a jumbo jet at a mall. What an idiot. 

This 5 minute time frame for so many people needs to be changed. Need some key figures and that's it. Too many opinions and not enough facts or evidence. Fucking frustrating watching this. God bless DFV and only few of those other Congress members speaking truth.
Good bot.
Best piece of DD throughout the whole hearing.
Most likely reading his speech
I believe it was "a non zero number", which I remembered because it was an expression I used.
All in on GSH? Got it.
Have you looked at him? Some homo.
Doesnt get much better than that
Wait, what about the cleaning spray and microfiber cleaning cloth?
Some interns work space
Who’s to say man. If I lost 20B of my clients money, I would be downgraded to a shitty printer box office too.
My personal favorite was the guy from Missouri who planted some kind of Garth Brooks book directly over his shoulder.

I think the least pretentious set up was the guy from MN using a hotel room desk and he had the internet connection to back it up.
Except the guy with the green screen
Melvin douche was just showing off how empty the office was after having to sell off everything. Don't make fun of him!
Looks like his office underwent a liquidation...  I bet the toner was pulled from that printer and sold off.
I have actual money invested with Vanguard Brokerage, they've been saying stay the course at least the entire pandemic.
I have 69 GME shares, down -60%.

Gonna hold anywayz cause fuck all the shorts.
They actively ignore the experts when they talk to them. The govt reps are bought and paid morons
Remember the internet tubes guy? It might be before your time but he was complaining that the internet was clogged up and sometimes he wouldn't get his Friday email until Monday. It's classic if you have not seen it.
If I’m lucky My wife and her bf were blowing him
[I could have sworn you said meow.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1rlSjdnAKY4)
Yes. One of the reps was trying to prove that he didn’t need the same prep and help as all the other lizards had, because he had a clear conscience and could just be honest, and also that he doesn’t have the same resources they do
probably not
No lol
No but his eyes said everything his mouth couldn’t
He was asked how many people were in the room with him. He said “zero”. And the rep said “I thought so” and mentioned how many other witnesses had been briefed and prepped by teams whereas DFV didn’t have the same resources.
IT'S A SIGN YOU RETARDS!    
FOR US RETARDS!
We can show footage of people getting shot and dying but we can't say his name. What a country
One guy almost said it, they were excited as to what he did and how he was able to answer a yes or no question.
In short, I like the stock.

I have been deeply in love with him ever since I saw him using Uno cards and a magic 8 ball to decide which stocks to buy. <3
Vlad over here for hours on end addressing simple yes/no questions “first of all I’d just like to set the stage a little bit” dude was drilled & no doubt had no idea what to respond, hence the same answers over and over.
Actually if you like to read look up "talking to strangers" really interesting story research about how it's very hard for people to pick up when someone is lying.
Unless your Ken from Citadel who was the 5th largest Political donor in 2020. And thus some politicians let him slide by quite easily on his lies.

Also Judge Judy - when it quacks like a duck, walks like a duck..it is a duck
This woman made so many wrong judgements by jumping to conclusions based on some rhyme she remembered
I had that same thought as well. He gave succinct yes/no answers when he was asked.
A few years back, dropping my car off for repairs, they asked my address...I could not for the life of me remember it. I had to look it up on my phone...I'd lived in the house over 2 years.
Rest assured it was some time in the last 365 days, Congressman. I wouldn't want to be any more specific until we do some more research on that.
When is your birthday? What about your ssn? Just curious. Don’t lie or I will be able to tell.

The Reddit CEO was so well spoken. He took these stupid boomer questions and explained them in layman terms for the most part. It was refreshing to hear someone defend what Reddit is and WSB. That is an executive I can support.
That was pretty epic I have to admit.
He said that last bit??
Did he really say retarded??
He likes the sub
That could be a possibility if GME goes to 69k or more.
Soon™
Yeah, guys a sleezeballs even if he likes this sub.

Just wait until this sub develops the wrong opinion, then it'll get banned
if its between you and the cat, im betting on the cat
He is not a cat. He actually said that.
I didn’t even watch the hearing but that’s so nice to hear like he still tryna give us a message even if he can’t talk to us directly on the sub probably for legal purposes
That's fucking hysterical, I didn't notice that
Holy shit. What a hero among apes
This is literally lawyers and politics in a nutshell
Plus it's even worse now because the testimony is not in person. They probably have a whole fuckin projection screen with what to say and a team of fuckin lawyers to skirt around plausible deniability and any other issue. And he said 5, there was probably 15. DFV is a class act and represented himself with more poise than anyone on that whole panel. I was surprised aside from the random 75 year olds asking useless questions at least 20 of them asked some actual worthwhile questions
It's pretty standard to have legal assistance during those things. That's where you get those dramatic sidebars where the speaker leans over, the lawyer whispers in their ear, and then they say "I do not recall."
For investor relations and earnings calls there is always a team of lawyers in the room with signs and cards indicating what to do.

Many ceos etc prep weeks for it. Its really one of their only functions.
The dude’s eyes were literally moving left to right while he was talking lmao. And whenever he had a break in his sentence it was like he was waiting for his teleprompter to write more for him to say.
His speaking cadence indicated to me  that at times he was, in fact, reading as it was being typed. He was a talking head, and not even good at it.
Thats a quote against Melvin (or maybe Citadel forgot which) when a Rep was basically questioning the amount of resources (legal team etc.) They have against retail investors WHO JUST LIKE THE STONK
> All the others have a team of lawyers off camera coaching them on what not to say.

All of them gesticulating wildly at their client, like stage moms in the audience at a child beauty pageant.
This is why they basically didn’t ask him anything. They knew he would tell the truth. It took like 4 hours before a rep gave him some respect and some room to talk.
This really should not be permitted
That’s why vlad said “thank you for the question mr/Mrs so and so I would love to answer that”. He had to give time for someone to type up an answer for him to read.
I think DFV’s was the most genuine and earnest of anyone who spoke today. He didn’t have a hidden agenda. Just spitting the facts, talking about himself and saying he liked the stock.
I would hope for his sake a lawyer went over it with him. I’d be shocked if he didn’t consult a lawyer because that would be a terrible idea to not get a professional look
To the moon, game stop.
Lol right?? Oh yeah and I was sad he wasn't wearing it, but I'm glad the headband made it in too xD Having watched a number of his livestreams, it was a little strange that he was so somber and not drinking a beer... But i'll take it xD Cheers everybody ;)
Gottem
Yeah, he was giving a superb answer and it didn't fit his narrative so he "reclaimed his time". P.s. Bless you papa
> Wait, his representative in Congress was able to cut him off?

It's not a bad thing per say. The time is on the person asking the questions. They have 5 minutes and are perfectly within their right to cut people off. We saw it in the favour of those that did believe the stock multiple times throughout the hearing. 

The real shambles is that the chairwoman of the hearing has previously taken in $800k payments from citidel to be a speaker in the past. 

She's absolutely not impartial.
Lynch represents the district where DFV grew up, but he lives in a different MA district now.
Time stamp is perfect. That congressman was leading the answer so hard with that question like it was a sports interview. It's like he forgot the guy answering is capable of generating his own thoughts.
what a fucking joke.
Holy shit.  He really was saying "stop disagreeing with me I regret letting you speak"
oh woooow
What a piece of shit.  People like him is why nobody trusts the government.
You're telling me I live a few minutes from DFV? 

Didn't know he is from Brockton.
someone mail that twat a box of bedbugs
My dad calls it Mass-of-two-shits. I used to live there and agree.
Link below cuts to this, and you're right dude looks like the child eating monster from Pan's Labyrinth. also after cutting dfv off, he starts his next bit and a few lines in he talks about upset in our markets, and it's very obvious how he feels about this situation the way he says 'our markets'
ROFL

National security concerns.

If the stock market stopped tomorrow forever, it would do a lot of damage, but fuck all to anyone's national security.

Even Lehman didn't damage national security.
You're right. I'm retarded.

I might have been refreshing the thread or something while he was talking. My main take-away was "What should have happened?" when the price was up in the hundreds, and my mind obviously went to "Well, people shouldn't have been stopped from buying, and the price should have gone to The Mars".

But the context provided by the rest of what he says indeed makes it sound like DFV answered what was being asked.

And yeah, DFV was never in it for the squeeze, but I'm sure he agrees that the price would've fucking mooned had trading not been halted. But that was likely indeed not what was being asked.
Let me start from the beginning, when I was a boy in Bulgaria...

Time stamp was correct for me, but here is a direct link for others.

https://youtu.be/shrkw-dV9S0?t=17215
Thank you. It’s at 1:18:55 the video you sent me is only two hours long.
wow that was transparent.  giving answer to a question, "i want to reclaim my time"
Future reference, take any YouTube video and add the time to the end and you will get a link to that time stamp for example just add ?t=1h14m16s to the end of the url and it will link it to 1 hour 14 minutes and 16 seconds.
What an ass-gobbler.
I love DFVs smile after he got stoped! He knew he nailed it!
yes or no
We well have to wait for the next tweet. So far we have

GTA

Mon-stars 

E******
Full homo.
He fired the interns to get their desk.
An HP printer at that. Complete POS was the message he was looking to send.
Guy with green screen probably just fired his intern for not setting up the correct background on the stream.
Me too lmao, never selling
More importantly, he could easily have the resources. He could have some coaching him all the way through it. But he didn’t need it, because he was just being honest. Absolute god
Good bot.
Good bot!
Crazy thing is, since his video on that, PENN went up like 5x in value. 500% bagger if you yolo'd all in on PENN.
My god that’s retarded.
DFV themed uno cards and 8 ball...shut up and take my money!
committee: "yes or no question"

&#x200B;

Vlad: "Let me take you to 1982, back when I grew up in Bulgaria..."
Don't forget citadel who couldn't answer a simple yes/no on whether buy orders from robinhood and fidelity are treated equally
then dfv- "thank you congressman, yes congressman"
Don't forget "I'd like to have this discussion at a more fitting time", like every other question they asked Vlad. What a deflecting worm.
Part of that is because it burns time. Time that could be used for following up questions and we want to limit how deep they can dig... you dig?
My fav was at the end when he was asked what mistakes robinhood made specifically. I lol’d. “I... uhh... ummm.... we’ll never make the same mistakes again”.
“I’d like to thank the congressman/woman for that excellent question... let me just stall a bit more...”
He's a good match for Cousin Greg from Succession. 
https://youtu.be/ED2pSguRn7U
He knew exactly what to respond, which is why his responses were vague and repetitive
Fucking love Malcolm Gladwell
In a one on one conversation where nothing is recorded and your testimony can't send you to jail, absolutely. 

If you lie to Congress though you have to really have your ducks in a row, making it difficult.
Its even harder when they can just do a video call instead of being there in person. Vlad would fold like a cheap accordion if he was actually interrogated by federal authorities.
What does she care, they throw $50m a year at her to judge poor retards for even dumber viewers so they can sell boner pills and miracle weight loss drugs.
To be fair losing a moments recollection of one thing is far more natural than an entire hearing of only giving up as much information as possible and treating everyone as if they don't know how the stock market works because you know once they realize what you've been doing the whole time the jig is up... lol
I got my oil changed one day at a spot you pull into and hang out in your car. At the end of it I for the life of me couldn't start my car, the tech looked at me and said "You're pushing in the clutch right?" I said oh ya and did, he then asked me how the hell I managed to get here if I can't start the car. I had to explain I've owned the car for almost 6 years now and I forgot about the clutch for a moment and then just looked at him until he opened the garage door. At least I didn't kill it leaving but I thought about it.
Bro one time I went to the ATM and completely forgot my PIN number. I had the same one for like 8 years. I literally had to leave the atm, go home and change my PIN number. Like, what is that?!
I had an Amazon driver turn up as I was about to get into my car on my own drive. He asked me if my house was number 8. I completely forgot my house number and had to check the door. I've lived here 17 years.
I need this, right meow!
We like the rating.
You have to be kitten me.
That's probably why a lot of old redditors came out of the woodwork on this sub.

Forget "To The Moon!"

Their money bet is "To The Movie!"
I really don't understand why.. in general, Chromebooks have very weak entry-level cameras. They are meant to touch up on a slideshow last minute, create a word document, streaming video, doing light web browsing or the occasional android application... not Zoom calling haha
Then yes. Chromebook all the way. Mine is like 5 years old and boots up in under 10 seconds.
Not that I specifically advocate for ageism, but you honestly should have to demonstrate a basic level of knowledge on the topic of the committee the leaders appoint you to before you get seated, which should include a, "current events" section.

Maybe it's not a test, maybe it's just an oral conversation with leadership, but holy shit some of these morons don't know the first thing about modern finance and that's clear.

The whole hearing amounted to, "Oh I guess that *is* how fucked up the system is currently built, yikes."  These people, of *all* people, should have already known that.  /u/DeepFuckingValue and /u/spez killed it, but why the fuck are they needed to educate these people?
Just before we start praising him, let me put a remainder that reddit will face backlash if the congress understood they were doing something bad, so in THIS specific battle, he is in our side so he played his part, he and his team will fuck us bare as they did to many others the very moment our interests don't align, and he won't even hesitate in get rid of the entire sub under other circumstances, let's not praise the commodore just because he is fighting the Spanish alongside us corsairs and privateers for now.-
No, he said the Reddit voting system helps to weed out nonsense, and that we're very good at spotting it.

*[insert Boston bomber meme here]*
Not with those words.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7N4S_FKMq4&t=3h15m0s 3:15:00 is the referenced line of questioning between Gottheimer and Huffman.
I had to translate it, I know half you autistic apes don't speak fluent bureaucrat
Sadly, not exactly using those words.
I doubt he would’ve defended /r/darknetmarkets with the same confiscation, but agreed

Edit: conviction, you think I did well in English? I’m in this sub for fucks sake
And sharing his wife.
“I’d like to clear a few things up.. first, I am NOT a cat” 

LMAO this guy is my fucking hero
That shit had me rolling during his opening comments
greedy scum
If there were actually 15 people, then Griffin lied under oath, and those 15 people become legal loose ends.
Griffin said he had 5 people with him in the room.
Thats all I could see in my head any time Griffin spoke. And much like a child caught with their hand in the cookie jar, they'll say whatever they can to get away with it.
I agree. That person is there to testify, not the whole fucking board.
Kinda crazy/really admirable that he can be charismatic while being deposed by congress
Just cause you didn't see his beer on stream doesn't mean it wasn't there.
Check his wife's PM's.
Favorite phrase by senators.

"This is my time, I am reclaiming my time!"
He is also the godamned congressman from DFV state of MA. He even had the balls to say, I should let Mr Gill speak, but proceeded to ramble on for almost 3 of his 5 minutes and DFV spoke for a total of 10 seconds maybe. Thank goodness these politicians represent us....
Straight up and then the second he realized it wasn’t going where he wanted it to he just cut him off like a proper cock waffle
Genuinely infuriating. The cunt representative totally treated him like a pawn and once it was clear he wasn’t going to confirm the narrative he was pushing he just cut him off. He handled that a lot better than I would’ve. I wouldn’t have just had a wry smile waiting for it I’d have been livid
or surprise glitter
Termites too
I’ve heard the seafood is really good, though. At least compared to the garbage seafood I eat in my landlocked state.
Don't be a Masshole.
\> My main take-away was "What should have happened?" when the price was up in the hundreds, and my mind obviously went to "Well, people shouldn't have been stopped from buying, and the price should have gone to The Mars".   

It's mindboggling to me, that they even have to ask.  

If you're an idiot who walks around on the highway and a schoolbus comes along, what's the fairer solution? You getting run over for being a retard who got himself into a retarded situation or crashing the bus and killing the passengers?
I appreciate the question…
wow, rep was fishing for an answer & not hearing it cuts off dfv, who was suppose to be their resource person. clearly an asshole.
MVP!
Thanks for sharing! DFV could have gone hours talking about share price irrationality and the Rep knows it
"I wanna reclaim my time"

lol get fucked you old boomer.
reclaims his time after taking 5 minutes to ask his question and only allowing him 40 seconds to talk
Odd. Sorry about that. Are you viewing the link on mobile or desktop? Not that it should matter but I’m curious. When I click the link it takes me to the video I intended to send you.
Let me start from the beginning, when I was a boy in Bulgaria...

Sir, I am not a cat.
He killed the intern without emotion
hahahha i fucking died laughing but im so sad because its so true. fuck these clowns like him
My man was wearing a green tie. He fundamentally fucked up from the get go.
Bet you it would have gone down if I'd bought :(
No way. Fuck me.
Henceforth he shall be known as Vlad the Imploder, aka Helmet Hair.
“The water there tasted slightly metallic in my childhood village, and the magical sunsets would accompany an evening breeze which held just the slightest scent of cinnamon...”
"I was born a poor black child in the Deep South..."
"I started in stocks by impaling those who didn't pay when the margin was called."
Henceforth, he will be known as Vlad the Deflector
I was born in 1982, let me get back to that at a later time.
He was counting on them not knowing the difference between closing and covering, and obviously they didn't. Couldn't yes it without doing a purj
Citadel answering a question:

"First and foremost thank you so much for such an amazing and important question, I'm honored to be here and thank you chairwoman for doing this. You see, it all started when I was 3yrs old, a retarded baby immigrant some may say. My great grandfather's uncle swam across the altlantic during the viet Nam war to put rice and beans on our table. During the Civil War times were tough for all, thankfully we have the greatest market on the planet."

Retarded congress person cuts them off to ask an even more pointless question

"Oh yes I'm sorry your question is so good it requires a very in depth aanswer. So where was I? Yes I was talking about the first time I got pegged as an intern at Goldman. That day I knew we needed to protect retail investors from their retarded selves. Life is tough for everyone right now guys, we're all just trying to make a living!"
They know. They just don't want to answer it until they are forced to. I'm glad this is all coming out. It's amazing.
"Thank you for the question, I think it's an important one..." *sweat profusely* "I'd like to talk about all of that... at a later date".
What's a more fitting time?
This is the Zuckerberg strategy of lying. If you watched them grill Zuck for censoring during the election, this was his go to line. "I'd like to get back to you on that" or "I'd like to meet with my team and get back to you on that".
we all reach an age where things like that happen.
Calls on AMC!
Kids. And cheap employers.
We have people running our country that can't even navigate to the settings on a smartphone. It's a fucking circus.
Then run for office.
You can be older and be tech savvy.  My dad died 6 years ago, but he knew more about technology than 99% of the people my age or younger, and he was 60 years old.

Conversely, nobody can be an expert on everything. The entire point of people politically appointed to offices is to have access to advisors in many different fields, or the ability to find experts.  They're **supposed** to be good at talking to people, listening to different views and expert opinions, and sifting through bullshit.  None of that entails being particularly knowledgeable in any one field. 

The problem is that with certain subjects, like the internet, phones, etc. They don't find it necessary to consult, or listen to, experts.  This is a failing in what their actual skills and expertise is supposed to be, not a failing in lack of tech knowledge.
Reddit is a business. We are the product. Never forget that.
I like that he acknowledges what makes reddit so good. Every comment starts from zero.
Thank you smort ape
Conviction?
God dammit I need a clip of this
Is DFV sexy as fuck or is it just me
I just like the stock
Next time I have to write a role model paper it will be about him.
5 in the front, 10 in the back baby
Probably 4 lawyers: 2 lawyers for Citadel Market Maker and 2 lawyers for Citadel Securities.
Balls of steel
Fair point... Fair point indeed
It's frustrating because it's very usage is defined to be for  "lying, misleading or time wasting answers" and yet we didn't hear it nearly enough regarding Mr Griffins nonsense. Quite frankly, it should have been used for every other fucking word out of his mouth. God knows there was plenty of time...between...his...words. Dude made Zuckerbot V1 look like the fucking T3000 from terminator.
Representatives;)
DFV needs to buy a house in that man's district. Establish residency. Run against this suited turd and take his seat in congress. It is the first step to DFV Presidency in 2028
u/DeepFuckingValue has the calm face of a man who knows he never has to work for anybody else ever again and has a net worth larger than that old shriveled congressman.
Just mix in the bedbugs.
Never hire...Tobias Funke
What should've happened, is even people waiting for months on unemployment to be paid, people outta livable work bc Covid, could have bought one share, even at $300, watched it moon to $1000, sold and made a few hundred bucks vs fuktards like Gillins raking in $352K per hour. Some who invested sooner, or were able to buy more could've payed off student debts, mortgages ( at least a down payment or kept themselves from foreclosure), on some ways the opposite of 2008 where a select few who betted against the system made BILLIONS vs the millions who lost pensions, houses, etc. I mean one can't get into the the 5 billionaire club withouta few hundred thousand living in their cars still working full time.
Just a random data point: the video in your link is 5+ hours for me, and the footage was right where you said it was.
Good bot
Great bot
I was born a poor black child
Then ate the corpse that cock mongler.
This is the way
You mean like AMC today at about 9:41? Then I sold just before it shot up ti 5.91....I have the golden touch for sure
Just checked too. Wow should have listened to that DD.
Or Great Value John Wick
Seeing his shitty helmet hair juxtaposed with DFV’s glorious flowing locks was therapeutic
"At the age of 12, I was gifted my first luck dragon. That's when I knew things would be different for me in life. I would do great things."
That son of a bitch.  Thank you for explaining what my idiot brain couldn't figure out.
Clearly best moment:

V: I admit we made mistakes

C: What mistakes did you make?

V: Uhhhh.... Always improving?

Fucking LMAO
Investor on RH made 3 billion. 

What is the rate of return 

3 billion

3 billion is meaningless without the rate of return. 

3 billion

WHAT IS THE RATE OF RETURN? 3 BILLON FROM 100 BILLION, FROM A TRILLION?

3 billion
Accurate, that's what happened every single time lmao
Probably confidentially behind doors where they can max profits and not risk arrest.
Maybe when you aren’t sworn under oath not to perjure yourself
Ah yes, the dreaded 24 they call it
Colorado Dept of Revenue Sales Tax division mentions on their site that they have an API that you can use to integrate into your POS or similar software.

I called them to ask how I can get access, and after two hours on hold and multiple supervisors being asked, they had no idea what I was talking about. They referred me to the software contractor that built it, who also had no idea what I was talking about.

So how did they build it? It's there. I can see it in dev tools. I can copy paste the basic auth header and use it. But they don't know what I'm talking about? 

corruption is the only reasonable answer I can think of.
1 if you're redditing on easy mode. Hardcore redditors downvote their own post at the start.
Fuck no. Mine always starts at 1 because I always vote for me.
Good ... bot?
[here you go!](https://youtu.be/ukXQGBpXaVM)

I fucked up the wording a little but it’s about 30 seconds in. This was his opening statement
He has nothing to hide
DFV already lives in that district AFAIK, or at least grew up there.
It's not just this but everything with this that is pissing me off. They are literally picking on the littlest fucking person they can. To protect some piece of shit people like Leon Cooperman. Fuck all of these people.
He's already in that man's district
Good point lol I’m sitting on one share I bought for fun with my brother at 300 lol maybe I’d be more level headed if my net worth were more than a dime bag
Fuck calm down satan
And termites
Yes or no?
Look at you now!
We sat around the house all day singing the blues.
Thank you for reminding me that movie exists. Fucking classic!
My phone died 20% in the good and when i got off work and got my phone on the charger i was down a good 15%~ whew. The curveballs life throws ya.
Dang dude. Maybe I should sell my GME and AMC shares so everyone else can get their tendies
Me too. Fuck. I even commented on that video that I should invest in Mattel like a fuckin idiot because he was consulting his uno deck and 8ball. I didn't even read between the lines.
"That's when I knew, with me the name Vladimir, would be pronounced as Vladimire; because all will be mirin' Vlad."
I still don't get it tbh
Or perhaps:

"Let me get back to you on that, congressman"
And that shit is under oath.
I laughed so hard GME came out of my nose.
That was infuriating!!!
Nonono!! Best moment:

DFV: I am not a cat.
the "i...i....i..." was pure cringe
"I work TOO hard. I care TOO much"
Wait, it gets *worse*?!
Fuck this is me
Honestly I was racking my brain trying to come up with any logical reason that could happen, how could the person they hired to make something not even be able to help you access it? Then it hit me.

It's the fuckin weed, man!


In all seriousness that *is* mind boggling. I thought that level of ignorance and incompetence was reserved for us southern states but it seems it's another national frustration for us all to bond over. Maybe the contractor figured no one would try to actually use it and had to bluff their way through? lol
Thanks for sharing this......I watched some but missed his part. He sounds the most well spoken out of them all. 

Seriously, most of the congressmen and women sounded unintelligent and some even drunk. It was honestly a joke watching some of them attempt to sound intelligent.

I am a Desert Storm veteran US Army, and watching them here today makes me regret that I ever volunteered to support and at one time willing to give my life for such clowns in our government.
Let me start from the beginning, when I was a boy in Bulgaria...

“I’m buying 6,000 shares of PENN” is between the lines? Are you an intellectual ape?
because is under oath is that they just avoided saying a single thing, worst part is that the members didn't push them to actually say shit under oath and just let them keep fooling around without really answering any key issue.-
I bought more
Buy the drip
You could see in his face he was absolutely gone.  Almost started laughing at himself when he fucking said it.
"Guess what, I have flaws. What are they? Oh I don't know. I sing in the shower. Sometimes I spend too much time volunteering. Occasionally I'll fuck investors. So sue me."
My weakness is that I'm perfectionist. Trust me
*Laughs in 30 yrs old* 
Oh my sweet summer child, yes... yes it does.
I agree with everything you said. There’s a piece of my heart gone where America used to be and I don’t know if that will ever recover. Thank you for your service and sacrifice. It definitely means something me even if those douche bags take advantage of it! Fuck them. You’re awesome. GME to the fucking moooooooon so these assholes can see what top ramen tastes like for the first time in their privileged lives!!
Run for office, give us something better.
I’ll have to reclaim my time.
Good bot
Give me a break. I was dropped a few times as a baby.
Always buy the drip.
I get like that when the white stuff I sniff to get through the day is running low.
No- don’t sue me. That’s the opposite of the point I’m trying to make
Thank you! Appreciate your thankfulness and words. We all sacrifice for our country and families in our own ways :)
Wish I could......I have a storied past of legal troubles in my youth! :) It would make Bill Clinton look like a priest.
TITLE: The reason DVF is so succinct in his answers.TEXT: The reason the great DFV is so quick, organized and succinct in his responses is because you don’t need to “prepare” to tell the truth. It’s easy to answer a question when the truth is the answer. 

Compare that to Robinhood or citadel and it’s clear to see who needed to “prepare” and be coached for these questions today. 

It’s unfortunately clear that this hearing will result in little to no action or changes going forward to hold big money accountable for their bad decisions, and the people will continue to shoulder the burden for their mistakes. 

I’m not here to stick it to the man, or take down big hedgies, I’m here for the tendies just like anyone else, but it’s very clear we will see something like this happen again in another 5-10 years, with retail traders and tax payers shielding big money at the cost of our tendies.#DeepFuckingLegend
He also doesn’t need to burn time to avoid answering harder questions.
"Thank you Congressperson, that's a great question. Allow me circumvent answering that."
(Knows there are 5 minutes to answer) "Madam chair, thank you so very kindly for this very important question that I will begin to start to answer very shortly after blowing another 30 seconds by telling you a story of the first man who conceived stocks and bonds"
I loved the congressman who asked him a question along the lines of "So you like the stock? uh huh, sure you do" Then cut off DFV because he was giving his DD and the congressman did not want that being seen.
Your so right. Watching Kenneth Griffin read off a teleprompter with answers being typed by a team of lawyers and experts in the room, was sickening. It leaves little doubt as to who is the shadiest player in all of this.
They’ve already said they’re ready to shut it down or limit buys if this happens again.
I'm just glad he was honest and upfront about not being a cat.
I don't see anything wrong with making money and coincidentally making a hedge's life hard asking the way.
Every single one of the corporate assholes are trained to burn the time and not answer the questions.
It’s also about weighted liability.

DFV he is his own motherfucker.

Everyone is beholden to something greater than self.
Crazy how a lawyer team coaching you will make you sound like a boring puppet, eh?
its part of being present. he is present in the conversations and is able to listen, process, and respond (like a natural interaction) 

on the contrary, vlad and the kenny g came prepared with their 3 different preloaded tickle me elmo phrases. they have predetermined their responses, regardless of the fact that they have no relevance to the questions being asked of them. therefore they are not present in the engagement, disconnected, and create a very unnatural interaction which is quite disturbing and highly lack lustre to witness.

more respect to DFV, cant say enough about the non feline being. absolute legend and stand up human being
these hearing are so dumb. 5 minutes and then you cut people off from asking or answering. I understand a lot of meetings are a waste of time but this exact time limit bullsht is the reason everyone should be fired from government. dumb ass rules
I had tons of respect for DFV before. Even more so after seeing how he handled himself today! #madrespect
Dfv should get his own ticker
“I am not a cat” - DVF

Best sentence ever spoken in the history of congressional hearings.
Griffin is guilty. We all know it. He’s pissed papa Elon whipped him. He wasn’t about to let DFV be a billionaire. 

AOC trying to shift blame. Clearinghouses are complicit. 

We care about being able to sell the stocks we held, at the price we wanted. Not when they told us we can. And selling them for us. 

Market Makers and Hedges and institutional investors, clearinghouses.. platforms.

All take our money. Returning how little?

Disgusting.

Robinhood protects market makers as hard as they claim to protect retail. Sharks going to shark. Congress is going to protect themselves. 

I’m also about sick and tired of hearing a tax will fix this. A TAX will just get passed along to us retail investors.
May i ask you how many people are in the room with you right now?

“Response” sure 0 sir.
Yeah, not commiting massive securities fraud does give him an edge
Thank you for your comment u/E223476, let me waste time repeating your question while I desperately try to figure out how to not incriminate myself and not actually answer the question.
While I think you're spot on, I could tell the 100% truth in scenario like this and still sound like a bumbling idiot. DFV is an eloquent speaker.
 Well said OP. While I don’t expect congress to decree that GME goes back to 400 and everyone gets a do-over, it’s disappointing to see  that the people/entities who were responsible for ‘almost crashing the market’ won’t be held responsible
DeepValueFuckin - I can get behind that.
just a lot of loud politicians firing pre written questions they don't understand and a bunch of corrupt billionaires saying "that's a very good question, im glad you asked!"
I am worried though, Keith FUCKING Gill affirmed he isn't a cat, however none of the others did and I am therefor suspect
When they asked him how many were in the room with him he said zero.

I thought thousands.
Absolutely. This whole thing is just a show. 5 minutes per senator is a joke if you want any kind of decent response out these guys.
You mean it wasn't his legal counsel?
The only thing that take down a scumbag suit is a bigger scumbag.. These politicians need their cronies but the private attorneys don't GAF about anything but getting that contingency award.  This could be one of the largest class action shareholder suits because it covers so many investors over many platforms and has so much circumstantial damage that was caused because of the fallout
Vlads answers looked like me trying to hit word count on an essay
“Yes”? Are you sure you don’t mean “I was not aware this was happening, despite being in total control of everything that was happening?”

\- CEO, probably
I think we're underplaying his preparation here. Being truthful helps with being quick, yes. But being succinct requires a lot of preparation, thinking, and synthesizing your thoughts into a few key talking points. He came prepared too.
Same for the Reddit CEO. He came across as quick, firm, natural, and charming. No hesitation. Knew his shit, believed his mission.

The guy from Melvin was good too. Accepted his loss, didn't hide, and from what I could tell was honest. Refused to speculate outside his area, too.
What we learned from Robinhood today is that they have their app set up to trigger users like a gambling video game. The retail buyers are their "product" that they sell to citadel.  They promote digital addiction. 

I am all for personal responsibility, but these guys are a bit dirty. No way they stopped GME sales for coverage. I firmly believe Citadel called and had them pull the plug.
The fact he is under investigation is a joke!
Man government is just shitty
That Tenev mofo speaks like Trump "thank you for the question, it is a great question". Lame ass strategy to gain time.
The real black pill? 
 
No one in congress actually gives a shit. They aren't actually confused about what happened. They know precisely what happened. A large portion of them have probably shaken these fools' hands at a fundraising dinner, listened to them go on about how important supporting whatever policy position allows this type of behavior, and will do so again at the next one. 
 
Congress' role in this was to get soundbites that they'll play during midterms to show how "I fought for *you* and pressured these wallstreet suits for *you*" because that's how this absurd game is played.
 
Every single moment other than DFV was nothing more than theater for the masses.
Aye, if we instant settlement or a HFT trade tax.
He also didn't once point a finger even when he rightfully could have.  He's a champ.
The lesson I learned is that you have to leave the casino before the casino breaks your legs
Vlad: thank you congressman for giving me the opportunity to answer that question. It is an important question. Aka: ummmm let me think. 

    Every. Single. Question.
At what point do we say "Fuck the dog and pony show of politicians acting like they're going to do something" and assemble in the streets to find accountability ourselves?  We have millions of apes and just last year the standard was set as to what those governing us find acceptable as far as "peacefully protesting".
He's also not being challenged or accused of anything.   


There's an implicit threat to all the other people's companies
It felt like Plotkin was on his own. Probably wasn't but looked a lot more of a casual setup.
I was very happy to actually sit through the entire hearing. 
You can tell the liars, the truth tellers, the congress agenda grandstanders,  the well researched and the others that probably joined late or have no clue of the system. 

DFV was succinct because he has little to hide, or because he has something to hide. I'm leaning to the fact he's telling the truth. 

Citadel I'm fairly sure that the CEO has plausible deniability, and same with Plumkins. 

They are CEOs and if every person in their employ is deposed the tree will shake out some rotten apples. 

Watch for any firings or buy out from both over the next year. 

Our reddit leader was the best and well informed and came across as the most confident. Well done.
He answers nice and quick so they have more time to question the main targets
I can’t count the amount of times vlad or griffin avoided an answer

Fuck tendies. I want to take down this corrupt system that provides an unfathomable luxury lifestyle for the very few, and inability to afford proper healthcare and food to 99%. Fuck hedge funds. Fuck robinhood.
Why wait 5-10 years?
He’s spent months being heckled and shit talked by WSB’ers who shit all over GME before it became the next meme stock. He’s more prepared than anyone lol.
Tendies on sale. Sell me your tendies so that I can have more tendies.
The dude, Keith, is incredibly smart and organized. Watching his videos, he does extreme amounts of research on what he looks into and purchases. I can see why his responses were so clear and well put together because he, himself, is very well put together. Knowledge is the greatest currency you can own.
facts
I’m very optimistic since a hands off approach will burn the short side. Always betting on no action from Congress. Or whoever these retards are.
DFV for president 2024.
I wonder how much time was wasted thanking them for questions. They probably calculate it the same way they calculate paying fees for doing illegal shit.
I learned where Vlad was born though. 14 times
ONE. HUNDRED. PERCENT.  Great point.
DFVs employer's should be proud to have him. He came off as genuine, knowledgeable, and respectful.
This.  
Its about being AUTHENTIC vs FAKE.
[removed]
Facts here. When you’ve studied the situation and know the truth because you sleep with the data while your wife sleeps with her boyfriend, then you know the answer. It’s that simple.
They should have just made it a DFV hearing, the others were unnecessary.
I’m just here because I like the stock.
[removed]
I believe you mean DFV.  DVF is what he will be doing after achieving his recent badassery and congressional conquering.
All I read was “tendies” at the end
100% agreed. The man just likes the stock. But DO NOT RESIGN to the idea that this will just happen again. Regulators either need to step in or step down and the hedges need to go to jail. #trimthehedges
"If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything" Mark Twain
What sort of justice system do you people even have over there?
I don’t think it will be 5-10 years. It takes some things aligning I agree, but you have a bunch of people that have huge power when they band together. Social media, like Reddit, can make this possible in a way not available prior.
I’m confident that there was a big whiteboard in front of Citadel with his team writing down the responses. You could see him pause mid sentences waiting for them to finish writing.  DFV needed nothing
It’s clear our government works in direct opposition to the people it’s charged to protect and represent at this point. 

This is what has really been exposed and laid bare in front of the country and world. 

The United States of America is its own greatest adversary. It’s us, the people, versus them, the politicians.
“How many people are in the room with you now”
I mean if you looked at Robinhood's prepared statement, you could tell immediately by the amount of footnote that there was some lawyer involved.
The issue is clearly that you're addicted to tendies, tap 1000 times a day if you agree
Easy when you, say with me: "Like the stock!"
The truth is like a lion. It doesn't need any defending.
Five minutes is not enough time. They should increase it to 8 to 10 minutes
> It’s unfortunately clear that this hearing will result in little to no action or changes going forward

always the case with these kinds of hearings isn't it. and yet the same people get voted in over and over lol
DFV is legit
While I agree he wasn’t really being asked more complex questions around complex financial functions and mechanisms. That being said he also wasn’t lying out of his ass like the others.
Hopefully this meeting will go down as a re minder to use the MUTE button when not speaking.
Holy Fuck, I can't believe how little people in this subreddit understand about how the government works...people acting like this is a fucking litigation in a court room....it's a fucking hearing. Literally nothing comes out of this, it's a waste of fucking time.  


The only reason they do this is so they can ask some dumbass question for another agenda they have. There were so many congress-members trying to box people into saying something about how reddit is bad and they would then use that as a means to repeal 230. It's a fucking joke.
Title typo. DFV** pls fix

~litquidity
The fight isn't over. The hedgehogs cracked open the ETFs with GME to short it.

Let's fuck them.
Wait I thought he had a prepared statement that he literally read and was posted in this sub?
In a addition to this, the man isn't selling a product. He's answering for his own, independent, personal financial decisions. Vlad is protecting his company by deflecting. No one is gonna come out and say, "yeah brah, our brokarage ain't got the money to cover basic transactions." He needs to deflect and spin to save his IPO and personal self interest. Public opinion has no bearing on DFV's success or failure. Vlad is in another boat.
A wise man once told me: "When you tell the truth there is nothing to remember."

Folks that weave a web of lies have a whole lot of shit to remember and it's obvious when speaking to them. Honest folk are very articulate as they don't have to cycle through the web to remember whether what they're about to say matches up with the given lie(s).
He's confident he did nothing wrong.
Still holding GME
Succinct? Is that another way of saying suck’nt? Because that’s absolutely correct. DFV certainly suck’nt
Deep Value Fucking
They got to make sure they have their stories straight
Well he's being sued too, so it's wise to be succinct and not go out of your way to elaborate.
There's a reason nothing will be done. The people doing the questioning are lobbied by, and have their campaigns funded by, Wallstreet and big tech. This is all a show, nothing will be done until we can get people in office with the testicular fortitude to stand up for the American people.
I do appreciate you calling attention to this, congressman.
I’m sayin. Somone with a bit of disposable cash get a lawyer in on this.
If there’s anything illegal about what they did the lawyer should (after researching some) be able to tell you, or even just prove they deliberately did financial harm (criminal vs civil lawsuits).
If they did do somthing nefarious or illegal they would be on the hook for financial damages.
And that’s not just money you lost but potential money you could have gained to.
That’s not somthing to brush off.
A class action lawsuit that is financial painful , or even destructive will send a stronger message than anything a politician would do.

You should just have to prove that it was a deliberate act outside of normal buisness practices, but I’m
Not a lawyer, so somone with the time/cash find one to weigh in on this.
We’re talking billions in damages to anyone that had the stock when they froze only the ability to buy stocks, that tanked the price.
Sorry, but even the truth needs preparation and a good advocate. He did a good job today because he was ready for it
Notice how they would slowly say “That’s a very important question......”, giving their people enough time to write out an appropriate answer.
DFV is the goat
As much as i love the god DVF he too was reading from a script
Good post. There’s really no reason to be coached on your responses if you know the truth is on your side
YES OR NO!
I’m wayyyy too retarded to know what succinct means. But I’ll look it up after my Dad is done looking for new baby-sitters on the internet.
Nation full of boot licking simps. The tone today was CLEAR. Retail needs to be reigned in and institutions are the heroes of the market. Shameful waste of our tax money
This is super accurate from a psychological and emotional point of view.
Nah, I bet he prepared
Because he is coached by lawyers for Blackrock.  Make no mistake that this man is a criminal.
Rep. San Nicolas had this same confidence. Because he was speaking the truth. My favorite moment today, next to DVF ofc [https://youtu.be/i8hJ9LwGvqU](https://youtu.be/i8hJ9LwGvqU)
yep, exactly what I said in the discussion thread

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lm7n51/congressional_hearings_dfv_gme_etc_megathread/gnwykun/
The reason for Vlad thanking everybody each time was to buy his team time to develop an answer.
Didn’t letters sent to the reps get the ball rolling to make this hearing happen? Why stop now? Letters to the reps should have a clear message, we want answers, action, accountability and reform.
more like we will see this happen again in 5 to 10 days or weeks. this shit is constantly happening. the rich move money around all the time to keep them and their friends and family rich. im just so glad someone spotted it happening and had the courage to do something about it.

inwish i myself could do something about it but dont know how. sure vote for better politicians but then what? we still see constant shit like ted cruz running off to mexico during texas power outages, trump getting aquitted after thousands of crimes and stealing money from charities, politicians who believe in conspiracy theories and even promoted assassinations of other politicians but got no punishments, the list goes on.
Why wait 5-10 years - Should do it every week, keep the pressure on until the scummy big money starts to flee in fear
As it was said by one of the members of the committee, “it’s political theater.”  Of course Maxine disagreed but she won’t make any changes for the better. She and many others have a freezer full of pre cooked, golden brown, crispy tendies.
Just busted so hard to this.
Are we able to force him to change his username to this? Admins? Mods?
Balls fucking deep in my wife
DFV is an honest, respectable guy. The others were painful to watch.

Congressperson: “I need a yes or no answer”
Asshole: rambles on about something while never getting close to an answer.
Congressperson: “I AM RECLAIMING MY TIME!”
It was implied that DFV appreciated all the questions and didn't need to tell ya everytime.
Vlad has been the worst! Not prepared at all. Dodging evey question! It's hard to watch.
Dfv is a clean guy
DFV he was playing in front of home crowd as well. That makes a big difference. Those congresspersons were not there to put him on the grill. One Rep. on the panel even commended him and “congratulated for his success”. 
It’s easier to be genuine and honest when you have nothing to lose by telling the truth. Ken and Vlad on the other hand were there to be grilled, and one answer not fully contextualised would have been framed against them. 

Vlad is the bad guy - a cyborg judging by his answers.
I appreciate the comment. It's an excellent comment.
I hate to say it but he also has to be very careful, everyone is against him and if he slips up and says something wrong (not that he did wrong, but construed as wrong) it could impact him in lawsuits or investigations.

They may have been beating up on Vlad but don't think for a minute they don't want to use dfv as a scapegoat
Thank you for your question, it was a superb question, and honestly I don't see how anyone else could ask a better question. Going back to that swell question you asked, I want to answer it because it was just such a great question. You must have really thought about it.
I'm so happy you said  that, that is the most important comment on the sub so far, one that we definitely should be talking more about.  Deeeeep breath
he also isn't in charge of billion dollar organizations in trillion dollar industries that need to be careful about their brand, and communicating the wrong thing by not making clarifications.

Bring on the downvotes
This right here. Those asshats rambled in circles until the clock stopped.
the bulgarian and the penis with arms and legs and a mouth cant handle the truth
They burn time to stall while the other, smarter, 5 people in the room type out an answer onto the screen they read off of.
Fuckin CEOs filibustering like theyre crooked politicians
What was the slip up that Vlad made when he accidentally said the word "public" and then corrected himself?
“Webster’s dictionary defines the word ‘stock’ as....”
YES OR NO
""this is something that I live by, and I always have, and I always will:  Don't ever, for any reason, do anything, to anyone, for any reason,  ever, no matter what, no matter where, or who, or who you are with, or  where you are going, or where you've been, ever, for any reason  whatsoever. "" -- Michael Scott
Like when dude from ant man gets hit with truth serum. 

"Sxotty grew up in a bad place..."
he literally said thank you for the question in every response, Citadel guy was reading from a fucking script. How blatant do you need to be caught out lying
If you want to filibuster go to the senate
If the congressman is being sarcastic towards DFV, what is the congressman saying?

Is the congressman being sarcastic because he thinks that DFV is lying? Because there's something beneath the stock that we're about to uncover?
Got a link?
[removed]
Loved the “Mr. Griffin, how many people do you have there in the room with you?” Dude froze.
I'm just jealous personally because he can actually read
The shadiest player is the one not even in the room: DTCC
While I am fully against these fuckers, I kind of understand why they are reading a script (more or less) from a business standpoint. If they say one wrong thing, they can be fucked in court. They dance around the questions enough and say the “right thing” to not have any consequences.

It makes complete sense that they are answering the way they are. Again, one wrong thing said or if they give a straight up yes or no answer, then the flood gates open and they’re fucked. Fuck em.
This shouldn’t be allowed. They shouldn’t be able to have a room full of lawyers and people literally writing in real time what they need to say.

It’s ridiculous! Kangaroo court!
More reasons to leave Robinhood.
True. We needed to know.
Glad he got that out of the way quickly.
But they're terrible at it at the same time
I pick blue crayon. They taste the best.
if any major network had a brain, they would update to the reality that people like him don't need networks to reach audiences. his youtube channel alone gets more eyes now than any show they could ever make for him, but instead of updating their platforms to compete with things like youtube and reddit, they keep making garbage shows and circle jerking about non-issues on their anchor/panel programs.
Im a millennial that hates CNBC and I would gladly watch it daily if they hired him
DFV is beholden to the truth.
“How many people are in the room with you?”  “Err 5 sir”.    To DFV - “How many people are in the room with you?”   “Just me”   “Yep I thought so”.
Boring puppet is a compliment, they sounded like they were reading off three different teleprompters, choking on every third word
Yep dog and pony show for politics to show the plebs and the do something crowd.
AOC was getting to the meat of the issue and half her time was wasted by someone trying to talk over I think it was Maxine's leathery ass. Bitch managed fine through everyone else got to AOC midway and oops i forgot how to work the zooms zooms.
They should really elect few reps that are articulate to ask the consensus questions. Some of the reps were incoherent in their line of questioning.
"All this could've been an email."

"Okay, then Mr. Smart Guy, I'll send it over. What's your fax number?"
#DeepFuckingRespect
I would pay good tendies to see a live chat with just DFV as everyone else testifies.
>Dfv should get his own ticker

He should make an ETF with that ticker
Let's also not forget Robinhood wouldn't let me set a limit order in case it mooned when I wasn't paying attention.

They said they didn't limit selling, but they sure as shit rejected my multiple orders to sell if it hit $5,000, for example. Why would they do this? https://imgur.com/Zx0IvHK.jpg
A small transaction tax won’t do shit to retail investors, but it would literally put HFT firms out of business.
Who was AOC shifting blame to?
> A TAX will just get passed along to us retail investors.

How though?

It increases the cost of frequent trading. That should be a disincentive to frequent, large trading like what citadel is doing.

If you are a long term holder, its really not hard to eat 0.1% every time you click the buy button?

Maybe money managers and ETFs will pass it on. But who will be hurt the most are big active traders.
Chills brother, for real he had the most apes in his corner lol
Senator?
His preparation wasn’t overnight, or for this hearing, his prep was the months and years of DD he put into this. 

While it is now in hindsight preparation, he didn’t set out for it to be.
after this hearing. i fully believe that we are going after the wrong people.  
naked short selling is illegal after 2008, its easy to prove this by asking melvin on the day itself who they intend to borrow it from to short.  
if u are short 226% of float, its only possible because a lender loaned his shares multiple times as citadel pointed out.  
sadly nobody drilled into this...
Agree 100 percent.
DTCC is most likely complicit in this as well, according to Vlad they were like oh you need 3 Billion dollars deposit in the next 5 hours at 3am. Everything about this situation stinks of bullshit
It's really the event that's under investigation, they're questioning him because he's involved and has a good understanding of it-- and will actually answer their questions
That’s not true, he’s being sued for securities fraud. 

I can tell you right now it’s more likely he faces repercussions then anyone else in this hearing if history is a guide. 

Robinhood and citadel could have sat there and said fuck you we stopped the rise because we wanted to a la petterfy and no one is going to do shit to them. 

These people blew the structure to shit in 08, politicians sold massive holdings in March with info not available to Joe trader and they didn’t do shit. 

There is ZERO threat to Melvin or Citadel coming from these reps.
For sure, I’m sure he had a couple people, but Griffin had 30 dudes, 10 apes, 7 retards, 3 teleprompters, one person typing who types at 7 words per minute and half a meatball sub in that room with him.
That’s exactly what he wanted the viewers to think. He didn’t want to further exacerbate the disconnect between his rich world and us peons by having his ‘real’ office background on full display. No. He wanted it to be low keyed. And so all you saw was him and a printer.
i doubt people who vote watches this.  
should tell you who actually does their homework and whos just a politician  


our reddit leader stated on record that reddit gives the best financial advice. lol
You mentioned something that looks like crypto. We get it, crypto is neat, but it's not our thing. [(Rule 4)](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules)

Generally people who do these are allowed to enter written statements prior to the actual hearing, then answer questions from the reps at the hearing itself.

The still normally need to be read in, which is what you say in the beginning of the hearing.
I mean peterffy of IB literally did that.

I’m so wet right now
Please mods, don't let anyone else have that at the very least.

/u/DeepFuckingLegend needs to be reserved.
I wish there wasn’t a time limit. Make the mf answer a question or live out the rest of his life in that chair.
getting a politician or other suit to answer a yes or no question would require an act of torture.  Such slimeballs
They're like, I'll get to your question but first let me give you a brief history of where I came from and how we have done business in the past...
"Thank you for that great question"
True but the congresspeople ask super loaded gotcha questions to which yes/no isn’t appropriate. The premise is loaded. Weasels on both sides.

DFV had been far the best performance, *by far*, in part because the questions toward him weren’t antagonistic, in part because there was nothing to antagonize; he’s clean.

“You make money from raping babies and selling order flow. Do you promise to give your order flow revenue to your users?” => “Ma’am, we don’t rape babies, we ...” => “sorry to interrupt, I don’t mean to be rude, but I’m reclaiming my time, I have limited time, yes or no please, are you going to give your revenue to your users?” WTF was that
Technically, they can hold them in Contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions (like Contempt of Court, but done by Congress), but they rarely do this.  

I think they should start.
“When you go to the bank for a mortgage...”
Exactly. They don’t want to answer with just yes or no because they feel like explaining will make it look better like we don’t all know that they are trying to fuck us out of what we should have.
Waters is a tough cookie
Vlad is gonna be so fucked in a deposition where he can’t rely on the crutch of trying to burn out his time.
He was very prepared.

He knew each rep had a time limit and spent every answer bleeding said time limit without actually answering the question. He didn't want anything exposed or said that could incriminate him or his company, so he took the softest approach.

DFV has nothing to hide so he answered questions directly and succinctly.
I kept having to mute it and look away for a second. He was making me cringe. What a scumbag
He kept looking to his left, especially when scared. Who's in the room w/him?
He was extremely prepared. He knew exactly how to respond to waste the most time possible while not answering anything. He spent weeks preparing for this hearing and did everything right. Robinhood will survive because of his prep.
Now this is a very good and a very important question and thank you for that, Congressman! Every. Fucking. Time.
The guy has been interviewed about this shit for 2 weeks now lmao
“Thank you, Senator, for the opportunity to be here today and address the question which you have just asked of me, today, during this hearing, about GameStop..”
Listen, if Vlad is guilty of anything, he’s guilty of always improving.
I was so negative about this going in because I thought it was going to be a very anti-DFV crowd. There were definitely those who were, but he set himself up as someone hard to look good attacking.

* You can't congratulate Vlad's American Dream story and ignore DFV's.
* You won't look good attacking someone who just recently lost a relative.
* You won't look good hitting hard at someone who was recently unemployed.

Basically, there's no looking good attacking DFV and a lot of looking really bad.
I didn't get to watch much... but did anyone see the gentleman from Guam absolutely crucify Vlad?
Yes you are correct.  In his goal of protecting the brand and avoiding further making his company look like the shitty company that it is, he succeeded.

For the goal of finding out the actual truth, he failed.  If you say the truth doesn't help his company, then maybe we all shouldn't be using his company.
He said he wouldn't be going public (shock). Can't remember what he corrected himself to saying though.
IIRC he said that their Assets Under Management figure isn't publicly disclosed during the discussion of converting $35B gains into an ROI for their accounts. He can't give that figure if they want to hide their AUM because you could get a pretty good estimate with it and a really accurate one if you combine it with historical data (like what a competing firm might be able to access, process, and put to use).

Announcing your AUM is basically saying "We think we've managed our risk so well we can publicly announce how much you could loot if you find a weakness."
I'm surprised he didn't tell a story about having to take the ferry to Morganville, which is what they called Shelbyville in those days...
The  Colin Robinson strategy

Hey, it sounds like you're struggling. Reddit has some great resources for any problem, but unless that problem is having too much money, WSB is not the right sub for you right now. Take a break for a bit. We'll be here when you're ready.

Ballpark when was that?  I didn’t get to watch the whole thing.
I think you're missing the point, which would be to add potentially +9 mil wsb degenerates tuning in daily. Plus,  YT is a completely different dynamic than hosting your own show 

He could be the one interviewing CEOs on HIS show, setting the pace/narrative. One day, hopefully,  he could even bring Vlad onto the show for a nice chat.  I'd love to see that
He is beholden to deep values
I think he actually replied “Zero”
Time stamp?
AOC getting interrupted while questioning the conflict of interest between Robinhood and Citadel by Maxine Waters being a dumb fucking Zoom call Boomer is just the fucking zeitgeist in a single scene.
This was super frustrating. Especially as she cut them off without acknowledging that she was nattering away in the background when she should have been silently chairing the fucking hearing.
she should have started with the meat of the issue instead of saving it for last. she has been in these kinds of hearings before and know how they work (or don't).
I want the answer at the question she asked in the end ;

how is your short position atm ?

plain & simple.
That pissed me off so much vlad fillibustered most of her time and her 5 minutes passed the second she asked the most important question of the hearing.
this
Ugh so frustrating
It’s just him in his headband asking everyone why they don’t like the stock. I’d watch that at an AMC
The actions they took made it so it's impossible to know how high the price would have gone had they allowed the squeeze to continue. Hard to make a case about what we could have made, and do only diamond hands get a settlement? What about those who got out because they saw how fucked the system was and took their earnings when they could have been so much more?

Their actions cut off the squeeze and intentionally created a sell off.

Nobody will be held accountable for this.
There's decentralized finance... but that leads to a discussion that's banned on this sub.
They did it to prevent trades at those prices within their own trading pool. There were no sellers under $500 at one point, and very little volume, and no apparent resistance in the order book up to $1000, and they weren't gonna let the stock gap up. 

Some customers had partial shares filled at $5000 because there were no sellers on the RH platform at all and RH had no shares to trade with.
A lends to B sells to C lends to D sells to E lends to F also inflates the numbers in ways that can exceed 100%. SI >100% does not promise illicit behavior. But it does need investigating.
literally, the stench is overwhelming. They had to pull the plug on retail buyers but not institutional...? I loved when one of the congress people corrected dear Vlad when he tried to say the retail buyers are his customers and she said no they aren't your customer is sitting right next to you. (Citadel.)
Yeah, what's ridiculous is that he's being sued.
Sad but true. I feel for him.
He's not being sued by the government, some people are suing him and it's never going to get anywhere. None of these questions are against him and no one is threatening any form of government punishment whatsoever.   


There's a lot of things being threatened here by the congress people though, one is ending PFOF, Transaction Taxes, changing rules on algorithmic trading and changing concentration rules as well as options trading rules.   


On the republican side they're pro-bank and large companies, so their threats are to small companies like Citadel and Melvin, and Republicans also hate social media and free speech, so the threats to Reddit are coming from them to attack anonymity. 

I don't know when people are going to get it through their thick skulls that Citadel and Melvin are TINY TINY TINY fucking companies.
Yeah when he said 5 in the room just made me wonder what kind of pandemonium was going on in the soundproofed room next door. Only half a meatball sub must have rustled some feathers.
I find that offensive. He can't have 7 retards, retards aren't that stupid.
He’s rich, but he’s not Ken Griffin rich. Plotkin is worth $300mm, Griffin about $21B... the difference in wealth is approximately $21 fucking Billion.
Please make this a thing. A SFW sub for things like this
Thanks to YOU, I just went down the rabbit hole of Reddit porn. *towels off*
agreed.
I agree, but do you really wanna sit through a 100 hour testimony for that?! I definitely don't. DFV is definitely going full on big dick energy on these suits
Yeah they should have made it 5 questions not 5 minutes, each question allowed 2 clarifications etc.
I've never understood the time limits you yanks impose in these hearings.

In the UK these CEOs would be hauled before a committee and subjected to lengthy questioning from experts. And the questioning can go on indefinitely.

Get experts in to ask proper questions and do away with the time limits.
There is. They can reclaim time at any time. If y’all would vote for me I would ask a yes or no question and the second they dilly dally I’d reclaim my time and scold them for trying to play me like some sort of fiddle.
Better yet: make it so they have a short time limit to answer a yes/no question. If they are unclear about whether the answer is "yes" or "no" then it can be assumed that their answer is whatever is more disadvantageous for them to answer. After all, there's no reason to be unclear about truthfully answering in a way that benefits you. It's like asking a kid with a face plastered with icing if they ate the cake on the counter without permission and then listening to them talk about how they were out playing with little Timmy next door instead of directly answering the question. Everyone knows what the real answer is, so why are we pretending we don't?
Look at Canada's "WE scandle" and see what happens when you let people just ramble off.   The Canadian Liberals fillerbuster committees and the softball questions they throw again get made super long answers.
Time limit should stop when the witness starts speaking
it should be 1 question per person, you can perhaps expand on the question with the chairs permission. If reptillian Vlad wants to dodge for 10mins he can, but its still getting answered.
You think you do, but you don't.
Theres a better solution than playing a waiting game: hold them in contempt of congress for not answering. Time to start exercising the law.
Or like, the ability to hold them in contempt, like in an actual trial where a judge can say “answer the question or go to jail.”
Yeah the format is a joke. It’s like the presidential debates
I’m ok with torture, because...NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION!!!!
Also, he always spent tons of time on thanking the congressppl for their questions so his lawyer could write away at his keyboard onto the teleprompter
I don't know...I think like Vlad was the only one that REALLY appreciated everyone's questions. That's what I got from watching him for 5 hours. /sarcasm
he copied  zuck
Ken already admitted that he had 5 other people in there with him. I’m sure they all had their lawyers within earshot. 

In Vlad’s case though, by how many questions he tiptoed around, it looked like he was reading off a prompt. Dude got absolutely GRILLED by a few of those representatives.
Probably a team of lawyers coaching him with cards and hand signals. Probably warn him if he’s starting to say something he shouldn’t admit.
Steve Cohen is standing just outside of frame with a shotgun
his coach. zuckerberg.
He did his job, which was don’t say anything stupid.
YES OR NO!
This shit I say to satisfy a boomer in interviews.
Many here seem to have a negative opinion of today's hearing but honestly from what I've watched so far, the cast majority of congressmen/women were on the side of retail investors, which isn't surprising because Republicans want to sell the American dream and left wing Democrats don't like big companies taking advantage of regular folks.
it was always an incompetent and scummy company from the getgo.

But these politicians wanted yes/no answers to some very nuanced discussion or wanted an answer in 1 minute. Was he delaying at times, definitely. But half of those politicians came in very obviously underprepared, hardly understood any of the matter at hand, and didn't want to delve into anything but just do their quick 5 minute grandstand and move on, while hamming it up for the general public.

Citadel and Melvin guys, especially Melvin i felt did a decent job answering all inquiries, i'll grant you that Mr. Citadel usually tried to avoid explaining how PFOF really benefits him. RH always wanted to give a long winded answer to everything while including pure PR . and at times made it more of a PR campaign (eg: when he gave total earnings without ROI%, which i call bullshit that he didn't know what it was).

There was an agenda, and you could tell by how questions were asked, and especially how you wanted to get an answer to nuanced and complicated topics in less than 5 minutes (not to mention that politicians spent probably 1 minute of their time patting themselves on the back and standing up on their soap boxes).

And somehow, our genius politicians didn't even call DTCC who was basically at the center of all of this to testify. Instead wasted DFV's time with that bullshit that he very obviously wasn't needed for.

I yield my time.
And I had tied an onion to my belt, as was the style of the time
Too much of my post history relates to that scene, but goddamn if it isn't cromulent all the time
Well actually, to really understand stocks you have to understand “capital” or currency. The driving force behind a “market”. And some examples of currency can be founds thousands of years back when islanders traded unmovable rocks and kept records of familial debt in oral history passed down...
Your profs didn’t explicitly tell you not to do that? Or they did and those presentations were that much shittier?
OH MY FUCKING GOD THIS BOT IS THE BEST THING THAT HAS EVER HAPPENED TO HUMANITY

\-cuts off DFV and reclaims his time, which makes Kitty smile...
Friggin South Shore nonsense.
Exactly what I was referring to. Thank you.
This lmao
New meme template incoming
About [03:03:28](https://youtu.be/1lh9KUA1iDU) when Juan Vargas is speaking. It's towards the end of his time.
Same, pls tell me so I can watch it
Deep fucking values
Shes gotta go the 60+ crowd of government is out of touch.
She made fair points before that but they have to ask relevant questions you cant just lead in with it and have no context. That's why everyone through a softball then rang one home.
I was screaming "CUT HIM OFF HES WASTING TIME" Like it was Mahomes dropping back in the 4th Qrtr at the SB trying to make a play.
I'd watch that on the AMC app on my newest BalckBerry while browsing the latest game selections at my local GameStop
I think Vlad giving an exact example of the order of magnitude of this event could quantify a round about sum. They seem to be able to say how rare this was, why not projected losses? (Gains for us retail)
That involves abandoning everyone else and I don’t want that to be the correct solution.
You said he wasn’t accused of anything.. which is untrue, you’ve now specified by the government. 

Currently no one in the hearing is facing sanctions from the fed, and it’s unlikely they will. 

As for citadel.... they are a literal market maker that trades 25% of equity volumes so I don’t think you know what your talking about.
>from them to attack anonymity

Except everything here (for the most part) is publicly viewable?

It takes some mental gymnastics to accuse this sub of something that these companies have themselves done in a larger, and even more blatent manner.
Here's to hoping the number one post is hedges loss porn
Looks like some jerk registered it and is now trying to sell it... smh that paper handed mf...
To force scumbags to answer simple questions about their guilt? I volunteer to sit for hundreds of hours.
I am baffled by the system actually. It results in such a random, disjointed line of questioning you are never going to get to the bottom of things. Why not draft a bunch of questions collectively and appoint people to question the relevant actors until they have answered satisfactorily.
This is why archbishops sequester when picking a new pope.  No one leaves till the job is done.  Pain and discomfort have a way of cutting thru the bullshit.  Eventually.
Yes. This is usually how a court works and people calling witnesses. They don’t have a timelimit. So why does congress?
I'd give at least ten minutes. Five minutes just burns through so fast especially when the hedgies can just BS for 4 minutes and they're off the hook.
I've watched GME ticker for over 100 hours easily. I can do this
No way anyone but dfv could go through a Bengazi style hearing.
Yes.  I have the internet.  I can watch a "best of" clip later.  Make those assholes squirm for the entire day until they answer the question.
This isn't supposed to be entertainment
That gavel came down at the end of so many yes/no questions. At least give 5 seconds for the witness to answer or not lol
I am already going to be holding my GME shares for millions of hours, so 100 hours ain't shit.
Yes. I would if it actually went somewhere by the end. Hold the dude by the dick, get the answers... We never do that ever and here we are.
Hell yea. If they want to filibuster, let them, we'll see them for what they truly are as soon as they attempt it. I'd rather get filibuster attempts than stalls for time AND unanswered questions because of time constraints.
Yes I do!
Guarantee it wouldn’t last 100 hours if they didn’t allow potty breaks.
>I agree, but do you really wanna sit through a 100 hour testimony for that?! I

For a congressman's salary? Yes, yes I would.

Do you fucking job scumbags
Vlad had that micro dick energy
Yes, I do, and we should. Dunking on them doesn't actually do anything. Forcing the assholes to either tell the truth or risk perjury is far more effective.
These politicians are barely qualified to utter a word, let alone ask questions. It’s fucking embarrassing that we elect these idiots.
all our experts are in on the scam, too, so it's actually a tossup whether a bunch of idiots asking questions at random is worse or not
dude it's a fucking HEARING not a litigation
They could do that if they so chose. They didn't, though.

The time limits aren't for the benefit of the witness. They're for the benefit of the other members of the committee. There's nothing stopping the chair from just granting someone more time because they feel like it.
I would but don’t scold them, that’s just wasting more of your time. Reclaiming my time.
>it can be assumed that their answer is whatever is more disadvantageous for them to answer.

You're free to assume whatever you like. Nobody's stopping you. You don't even need to listen to the hearing first.
r/unexpectedMontyPython
Yeah, this is probably it.
That’s exactly what a cat would say. Makes me wonder... how many people are in the room with you?
He didnt awkwardly drink water.. atleast on screen
I was really excited for aoc interrogating the melvin holocaust-abuser but v-boy really had to “thank” her for every fucking statement or question she made
Grilled doesn’t matter shit. You have any idea how many times Zuc was grilled?  No?  Yeah, because it doesn’t matter.
He prolly thankes the congressppl to win time so the lawyers could impro a script for the teleprompter
The PA rep got him real flustered by asking what his mistakes were. He was bullshitting throughout the whole day but this was [a whole different level](https://youtu.be/RfEuNHVPc_k?t=18431).
I really thought it was Zuckerberg a couple of times. "Senator.... we sell stonks..."

This is at about 5 hours, 6 minutes and 15 seconds for anyone who wants to see [a man waiting to see what's he supposed to say] (https://youtu.be/1KB9u9bUCL4)

Edit: My bad, 5 hrs not 6
Make it so
I mean not really. He first couple were weak af.   

What was all the time wasted trying to get vlad to “agree” to paying back proceeds from order flow?? Like that’s literally how the business generates revenue. Where was she going with that. Was he gonna be like “sure actually yeah take all of our operating revenue”
she’s too nice. She even apologized for interrupting him. Others were like: I RECLAIM MY TIME.
Because vlad saying it's a one in 35 million day event is **beyond dumb**

This is something that pissed me off a lot about this.

There have been **over a dozen 5+ sigma events since 1990**.
That's 3 decades, over a dozen events of this magnitude or greater.

*wallstreet's risk assessment is fucked and they are in no rush to fix it*
Everyone else needs to come along. The only way to truly end the oligarchy is through revolution. The information age would make today's shenanigans superfluous.
I reserved u/TheDeepFuckingLegend so DFV can have it any time he wants
I hate this stock
Goddamn that didn't take long.  Rat Bastard
What about u/DeepFuckingGod
Dude says he's willing to sell....I don't think he understands that WSB doesn't appreciate that mindset.
I don't mind being there with you, but wake me up when something important actually happens... or when DFV drops more subliminals

Edit: Fucking apple changing DFV to DMV
Ive already sat for hundreds of hours during the covid. Whats a few more?
Same. Enter every word I to the record. Greater chance for them to incriminate themselves.
Same. Sign me up. You start bleeding out the big dogs and the others fall in line. Make them sit on a fucking 40 hour zoom call. Do your jobs.
Yeah these guys aren't Leslie Knope, doubt they could filabuster for more than 30mins when you got Waters constantly going "please answer yes or no".
It’s show trial, man. Best case this is an opportunity for these Congress people to campaign in front of people who would never watch shit like this. Worse case they slap regulations on what we can do. This doesn’t end with any positive outcome for us. Shit, the stock dropped during the trial.
Filibuster is just an old timey term for trolling. And as amusing as trolling is, it has no place in a Senate hearing. They need to get their poop in a group and just fucking answer. I don't want to hear an asshat talk in circles for a hundred hours. Just fucking answer the question, or deflect and let us assume the why you deflected.

Talk shit, get hit (by specification)

Thank you for that important question...
Because then they get to say they did something while not really doing anything.
Nah, then they don't get to pay themselves on the back. One dude burned 3 minutes asking everyone to pray for texas. The Congressman from DFVs own district yammered on for most of his time before asking a question. It was an absolute farce.
No kidding.  And it would cut through the 2 out of 6 hours where someone is just blabbering about how happy they are to be here, and how great the question is, and how they've served their shitty district for 40 years, etc.  Just answer the fuckin questions, and they don't leave until they do.
Come on dude. That makes way too much fuckin sense. Plus, it's better to look inept than to have some tidbits come out that could be damaging to to someone with influence or wealth
The same reason the "presidential debates" have been so thoroughly derided in the last decades. Candidates are so coached that even if they do have skills they have learned not to trust themselves and are more worried about making a mistake than speaking from their experience or perspective.  

While I completely disagree with the politics of the dick who said "this whole proceeding is polictical theater", because he said it as he doesn't want anyone held accountable, public hearings like these with shitty formats end up being exactly that. 5 minutes? What a joke. It guarantees no accountability and no depth as you can't even follow up on a complex thought.
It’s just an organized form of grandstanding.
Not saying I understand the system, but there are two parts that should be thought of separately:

One part is the idea of risk management, risk transfer, shared default fund among clearing house members, settlement, capital requirements.... all of that stuff.  Vlad has been saying that this part of the system is what fell short and put Robinhood in their tough situation that led to the trading restrictions.  I didn’t get a strong sense that others on the panel, or indeed many members took that position. Personally, I think Vlad is being disingenuous and using this as a distraction.

The other part is the execution piece (the actual trading) and it includes concepts like payment for order flow, wholesaling, dark pools, and all the stuff that this hearing seems to be more about than anything else.

I enjoyed listening today.
Cardinals. Cardinals pick popes.
Pain and discomfort you say, have you heard of Phillip V of france and how he [locked cardinals in a church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1314%E2%80%931316_papal_conclave) for a month and a half because they were refusing to elect a new pope?

(They elected a 72 year old man bc they thought he'd die quick but ended up staying for 12 years)
I remember a summit that happened years ago. Held in Akron, Ohio. In winter. The most boring town in the most boring state in a season best suited for staying indoors. In a vanilla hotel. Things were worked out earlier than expected.
It’s called a papal conclave and technically God picks the pope, merely acting through the cardinals, you absolute heathen
The only thing you need to watch is how crispy these tendies get while we're preparing for liftoff!

Edit: my dumbass typos. Can we get a spell check to work, or.... cuz I'm tired of Reddit reminding me that I was last place in my 3rd grade Spelling Bee
Because in a court of law you are trying to reach a verdict. In a congressional hearing you are trying to get a soundbite. The five minutes is so everyone can get a turn.
So that everyone gets the same amount of grandstanding. Ostensibly they aren't trying to actually prove anything or make a case for anything. They're trying to learn things so they can make informed decisions about what legislation to pass. It's not like a court, it's more of a Q&A session after a speech.
That or they getting fat stacks before and after the hearing.
Gotta scold while reclaiming.
How do we know you're not a cat? Let's see.  Have you ever drank milk?  Do long hairs grow under your nose? Do you now or have you ever swatted anything? Do warm blankets ever make you comfortable?

Judge, I think we have a cat lawyer, here.
I mean, really she shouldn't have tried to rehash everything in the first place. If you really wanna make them squirm, ask them something they haven't spent past two hours talking about.


....like SI or failures to deliver.
To be fair, she’s been in Congress long enough that she should know how to deal with it without wasting time. I’m overall disappointed in her performance. 

If it was me I’d be cutting that off and talking faster than an auctioneer getting shit done. As it should be since this is how it works. Reclaiming my time.
Never claimed it does matter. Just like the hundreds of millions they’ve already been fined for similar situations, it’s just the cost of doing business to them.
Uh my greatest mistake is always continuing to succeed. That's like the stupid ass shit you say in an interview when you are a teenager. And this dumbass said it to a congresswoman. This is the mind of answer you get when your lawyer can't answer for you.
“My biggest mistake is always improving”

Fuck this guy
Anyway, it’s like I always say, I needed a new heel for my shoe.

i do not like this stock
Sir this is the DMV
Puts on AAPL? Got it
I’ll have a liter of cola
>The Congressman from DFVs own district yammered on for most of his time before asking a question. It was an absolute farce.

Then he asked DFV a question and cut him off after a sentence, when he realized he wasn't going to say the stock is overvalued at it's current price. Fuckin Muff Cabbage.
If you've watched any congressional hearing ever, it's what they do. Some don't want answers, they want to bloviate endlessly.  Ex: Gym Jordan.
No, Cardinal was an X-Man.
Crisp from the flames of our rockets!

Delicious.
Thank you for asking these important questions, Congressman
I appreciated the semantic trap she tried to set on Vlad, but ultimately it was doomed to fail since it's retread ground by the time it was her turn. Overall a disappointing performance, but that goes for most of the congressmen and women (especially some of the older ones who I felt had little idea of what they're talking about, like that one guy who complained about why RH is not moderating social media. Like, uh...what? lol).
It's about 5 hrs 6 minutes and 20 seconds into the hearing. Sorry for my mobile bs but [hopefully this is it](https://youtu.be/1KB9u9bUCL4&t=5h6m20s)
This stock is a fun ruiner
Sir, this is a Wendy's
Sir this is DFV
Well yeah, your a Psiscorpion. Totally different branch.
You're thinking of Bishop.
Considering they'd been refusing for 2 years it definitely worked, although the ethics of locking a group of old men in a church with minimal confort, food and water are dubious, one could envision a similar solution to government shutdowns for example...
Flaming tendies? I’m in.
My favorite was multiple congresspeople unironically calling it “gamestock” .... like wtf ??
That is it!  Holy shit, his sideways glance at the end.  My bullshit meter is off the charts.
Yes this one works. Bla bla bla. Wait for dramatic effect. Bla bla bla. 

Wow it's worse acting then some porn I've seen. 

You can see his eyes following the text.
Let's short this stock into oblivion
Its a Wendys DMV! The ultimate source of Wendys in this $200 billion industry!
I'll have a Large Farva
I made pretty decent coin on Wendy's!
Great!  Gimme all your tendies!
Dude where can I sign up to be a psychic scorpion I want in
It wasn’t in a church it was in a Dominican convent, convents are designed for people to live in them. They have bedrooms etc, and vegetable gardens etc. Often self sufficient. And cardinals, especially medieval cardinals, aren’t necessarily old. A lot of them were “Cardinal Nephews” basically powerful 2nd sons of Italian families.

Edit: apes retards autism etc
i mean he is literally reading with his hand lol
Dude. Do you know how much Wendy's I could scarf while at the DMV?? 

Now get them to bring back the tendies. Those were good.
$WDMV is the next move, not financial advice.
I'll have a liter o' cola and tendies.
Do we sell liter Farva?
Can I get a liter of Cola?
No mines an iphone.
TITLE: Forbes quotes DFVTEXT: “I am not a cat”

-DFV on the cover of Cat Fancy
Was actually shocked to learn he was not in fact a cat
That red bandanna will hang in the Smithsonian one day
My favorite is the hang in there poster behind him
That’s honestly a smart thing to say. $200b gaming industry + GameStop is the biggest gaming retail store = $15b market cap is not an insane thing to happen
Plot twist: DFV is the Gamestop CEO.
Gill had no problems answering anything yet 'professionals' struggled, read scripts, and had SEC coaches.  DFV > anybody else at the hearing.
GameStops recent hires at the corporate level are promising
In short, I like the stock
I spent a good part of last year reading leadership books. And doing little linked in learning things. One thing they almost all agreed on was that a great leader needs to be able to explain their goal for the company in the time it takes to ride the elevator from ground floor to 3rd floor. I predict this is about to become the example they give you as reference.
Soooo, we're buying gamestop again, check
Meanwhile the stock is still being held hostage by fraudulent and corrupt people. With a totally artificial price... What a shame and disgrace  on the system.

This makes me miss how console launches usually are. Going to Gamestop to test the demo unit even though the controller would be absolutely disgusting from everyone using it. 

Most people haven't seen a PS5 in person yet.
Somebody has to put a red bandana on the Wall St. Bull.
All I want to see is him in a GameStop commercial when it reinvents itself. 

Like an employee flipping the open sign with no mask on signaling the end of COVID. He looks up. He smiles. 

“Glad to see you man. We were expecting you. Come in!”

*Camera cuts to Keith Gill.*

“What can I say? I like this Shop.”
There was nothing else to quote really its been consistent nonsense. This is basically the committe trying to understand robinhood as a business and robinhood putting on an investor conference with neither party caring about the other
It's almost like this guy is smarter than the average retard sitting in congress.
Hedgefucks: “The crumbling physical video game space has GME overvalued”

DFV: “If GME is smart they’ll get a piece of that sweet sweet $200BN game industry asssss”
Lol his picture saying “Hang in there” kills me
I always shop at the one near my house. They are doing great still!
He's not wrong. I find it amazing how most investors didn't see the potential of the gaming industry during a PANDEMIC where most people had to stay at home and probably played more videogames than usual.
isn't ThinkGeek like a branch of gamestop?

gamestop could ditch the tiny stripmall stores and revive places like closed toys r' us stores by expanding their thinkgeek merchandise. no hasbro shit or bikes for kids, they all got ipads nowadays anyway.

such places could also host local cosplay contests, gaming tournaments. so many possibilities
That's what I heard lol.
If they’re truly committed to developing they’re presence as an online retailer, it’s not a crazy idea. 

Amazon is a shit hole for buying video games online.
Agree
I’m not your cat, dude
Stop I can only get so erect
I meam hes not wrong. The chewy guy was brought in. If they work with xbox /microsoft to integrate into a platform where they can have their web platform work with them, and share that online retail space, and microsoft gets access to more direct sales and service though their brick and mortar.. It could totally change gamestop and make them profitable, breaking from that used game bs system they are stuck in.
Aka squeeze is not squoze, Senator
"I like the stock". He absolutely knocked it out of the park whenever they called on him.
/r/quoteporn
I’m using this opportunity to buy at a discount
Going back to the moon,
"I am not a cat"

But appears to be among a bunch of pussies...
In other words, he likes the stock
Not all heroes wear capes.
First mistake of Shark Tank: mentioning the size of the industry.

For that reason I’m out.
I like the stock!!!!
This has been a great day
Legend!
HE LIKES THE STOCK.
DFV for GME CEO!
He will from now on be known as a creditable not a financial advisor financial advisor
now when is GameStop actually going to do the speaking for their own company?
“Hang in there”
DFV!  DFV!  DFV!
GameStop kinda needs to do something like steam
His name is fucking Keith Gill
On a serious note. What can GME do, become another steam? Is there mechanism to resell digital games? If not there should be, even if publishers don’t like the idea.
Amen. It’s why I like the stonk. Holding at high prices with 0 fucks given
The only ‘feel good’ story of the past 12 months...truly happy for this dude. If I’m ever happy for someone else again I’ll think of DFV and smile a little smile.
DFV sounding like a professional out here representing WSB
Gamestop needs to realize that men don't really shop, they need to focus more on female gamers, which means ditching the mouth breathing neck beards behind the counter. They do that and I think they have a good chance at saving the brick n mortar side while they build out the digital side.
Inspirational
We like the stock
He just likes the stock
I like the stock
This is the way - Good boy Forbes
What a legend.
He likes the stock
I'm not "a cat".  I'm "THE  CAT"!
He still like the stock, i still like the stock, we are not cats. Today good day.
DFV is mah president!
I believe
DFV for WSB President! :)
I like this stock.
Squeeze not sqouzen?
Watch GameStop hire him
With all this publicity gamestop has they need a big computer tech line in there store to complete the total gaming store
No cap
They should just make the man ceo of GameStop already
GME should hire Keith Gill
Gamestop, get to work, make this happen. I love the stock!!! I love Gamestop!!
GameStop won't be anything until it starts selling Computer components 

ez win
I'm just sad they cut him off when he was mentioning Ryan Cohen and his new bull thesis
Fucking legend
Ryan Cohen owes DFV an evening with his wife.
I like the stock
My Guy just likes the stock
Ready Player One!!!
Fucking gold
I would follow this man into war.
This never sees $50 again, does it?
He has a point though. If you look at everything he said, hes right that there isnt a place that just dedicated to gaming. Now, there is small shops and such but at a coporate level, gamestop really it. If they can reinvent themselves, they have a chance to really be successful in the gaming community again.
It’s funny because he’s 100% correct. GameStop has serious potential to become huge given the enormous growth in the gaming industry. With someone like Ryan Cohen leading the company, sky is the limit.
He by far did the best job today.
Big coin = own game Development  + Cloud services = Gamestop revival.
I think the stock is cheap, I'm no expert and this isn't advice but personally I am buying more tomorrow!
Fuck it just bought 3 more shares!
**$200B GME PRICE TARGET CONFIRMED**
You know what... I totally understand his view on the value of GameStop now. I can see GameStop becoming a place where I’d drop by once a week  or so and play video games with random people and just chill. Tomorrow I’m going to buy at least one share of GME and just hold, never sell. Tribute.
I LIKE THE LEGEND
DFV for prez 2024
I just don't understand why Gamestop doesn't sell anything pc related. They should sell graphic cards, Monitors, mouse, gaming chairs etc. Aren't there good margins to make on pc parts?

If they have stores with bigger space bring back the arcade type feel with games you can play on site. Arcade bars are/were super popular before covid, I bet after the pandemic people will want to go out  a shit ton more than before. The can do something around that idea. Game in the same space with friends and other like minded strangers? I'd be in for sure.

There is so much they could do if they have the capital, pivot and change the business model a little
also Keith Gill:  "I believe blockbuster is still around to compete with all other streaming services in the next decade"
I LIKE THE STOCK GEEEEEMEEEEEE!!!!!
Did he say it and manage to keep a straight face?
That is pure BS.

* The Series S and PS5 DE don't have a disc drive and will outsell their disc drive versions. 
* Game Pass has 18 million subscribers and is growing rapidly.
* Amazon is the king of delivering physical copies. Walmart and Best Buy which also sell games have retail stores of their own and much closer to gamers than GameStop.

The fact of the matter is that GameStop is being killed from all directions.
What unbelievable bullshit.
Yaaaa. Suuuuure
"Hi fellow kids!"

reminder that forbes is just trying to tap into the movement to get some free followers and clicks.
MaRkEt MaNiPuLaTiON
Reach and preach. <tips hat>
Of course he is going to say that.  But that was never part of his thesis. <eye roll>
I just dont see it sense people will buy directly from the store on the consoles.
Forbes is the ultimate shill. They’ll post anything to get clicks cause so much of their revenue is from display advertisements
PUT THIS MAN ON THE BOARD
This is like the live action remake of Lego Movie.
Could this of happened with blockbuster??
Same
This guy needs to be on their board
How many times did he use the word “Stonk” ?
I hope GameStop hires him. He has single handedly been the best free advertisement a company could ask for.
Takeaway "Hang in there"
that was a bunch of pr bullshit, he really just likes the stock, as we all do, even my auntie
Somebody spoke with a good attorney.
Idk who, but somebody did.

This guy is smart.
DFV making sure the apes hold
Good point... And the stock crashes
Talib came out swinging for the fences... Too bad we were watching a chess match and not baseball. I'm ok with a basis point or 2, fuck em. It would make hft unprofitable
And honestly, even if he DIDNT believe this, it doesn’t give predatory capitalists the right to kick the proverbial legs out from under it while it tries to reinvent itself.  There are humans who rely on their jobs. What WSB pulled is a fucking game changer. It woke me up and now I’m investing
Are we buying shares again?
Now they gotta
GME better make a shrine in honor of DFV... and make it the Mecca of GME supporters
If I was Ryan Cohen I would offer DFV the job of SVP of Investor Relations.   Of course with lots of stock options....
Link to video?
Gold D Roger
If Gamestop/RC don't offer this man a job there's something broken in the world.
does he actually think that gamestop is a good store?
“He’s literally Hitler and should be punished as such!” -CNBC
He’s PR floating it
Dude just earned himself as Gamestops PR ...legend
When Cohen’s CEO they need to put DFV on the board.
get this and arcade where you can play on consoles ,with your own or rented games
If Gamestop doesn’t end up hiring this guy in some capacity when the dust settles I will be shocked. Spokesman, something. I’m investing in GameStop because of all the free damn advertising they are getting.
I fucking love this man
He said he is not "A" cat...but maybe he is 3 cats in a business suit
can’t be a cat if you were born THE GOAT *shrugs*
Totally something a cat would say
He’s going down in the investor HOF
Not to be confused with the cover of Fancy Cat, in which they print the same statement.
I am not a cat. I am legend.
this was the most under appreciated meta memelord comment ever!
I wouldn’t have believed him if he were not under oath
A lot of cats these days use a human-face filter. Just saying.
The most shocking detail for me that was revealed in this whole hearing was that DFV was in fact, not a cat
Coz he has the human filter on correctly this time
People won't be able to take a picture of it with flash photography incase it damages the colour.
I would have loved it if he wore it with his suit and tie!
Gamestop is gonna start selling 'em
Right next to Betsy Ross’ flag. Salute!
And the bandana hanging on it
[Just in case anyone needs it](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1166380-hang-in-there-baby)
Is it being sold at GameStop yet? I will buy that poster but only as a rewards member with GameStop.
This is the sign from DFV. It’s so obvious it’s literally in front of our faces. If he’s still in, I’m still in!
His analysis of GameStop on YouTube was pretty good. Holding out his position for over two years and counting, and him going against the tides of speculation that the business is doomed was such a ballsy move. He’s a great and heroic equalizer in a greedy playmaking game.
Chewy is a 45 billion dollar company in a smaller industry than gaming.
Especially with their current management. Chewy has astoundingly good customer service, and that's been the main problem with GameStop's retail branch. If they could rebrand themselves as an "Apple Store for gamers" they could make a ton of money. Some ideas:

 - Offer discounts on games with the purchase of an upgraded video card, with free installation
 - Two hour delivery of anything in stock so you can keep gaming
 - Host gaming competitions, both professional and amateur. Esports are growing at 9% annually
 - Host weekly LAN parties where you can play the latest games on the latest hardware. Rent this space for private parties and meetups
 - Host retro gaming/retro PC swap meets and meetups
 - Buy all the old Sears and turn them into VR arcades/theme parks
And at this point it would be weird if that prediction *doesn't* come true. This is a golden window of opportunity for any brand, let alone one that has become the forefront of something this massive. 

The attention the brand name got just from this story alone will give it ultimate lift. Add on to that the countless stories of people who *genuinely love the gamestop brand* and recognize it as part of their childhood and life. That's coca cola/disney level branding. All of that being brought into the public is multi-million dollar market research level good. 

Forget about the stock (not literally), Gamestop the *brand* is in a home-run position right now and with all the talent out there it would just be *downright weird* if they didn't capitalize on this and do big things. Someone would have to mess up pretty hard.

**edit** I am not a financial expert but I am in marketing. Also, if anyone from Gamestop is reading this I'll gladly work for you guys. First new tagline is free: "We Like the Players. "
I don't see them lasting unless they make an online PC game store and client to compete with Steam, GoG, and EGS.
GameStop and Microsoft deal.  Microsoft is pretty big I hear.  
https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/
AGREED. I’m buying more GME in the morning.
true visionary, DFV is
Me and my wife were watching him speak and she said the same thing. There's only one thing to do, he needs a high backed chair to sit in over at GME.
If he wasn't before, he will be soon. This whole situation is legendary, GME couldn't have bought better publicity.
Plot twist: DFV is a cat.
undercover boss
Current CEO is probably shitting himself. He's gotta step his game now that DFV called on him
Reddit CEO had great quality as well. One of the only other ones to actually have clear picture quality and no background noise/static/echo microphone.
No shit you’re right!
Citadel CEO Ken Griffin was forced to admit he had FIVE people in the room with him during questioning, and the entire time he was looking up at something instead of at the camera.
I hope this helps to dispel the concept of "experts" in your mind. Most experts in congressional hearings, on tv, and on the radio are the exact same but you don't know enough about their industry to be able to notice their bullshit.

The elites are not as elite as they make themselves out to be. I know redneck farmer millionaires that know more about stocks than all these congressmen.

Talk to them and they seem simple and uneducated then they casually build a house or weld together a car from scrap parts and engineering blueprints they drew up.
100%. While he didn't get asked as much, and in some ways rightfully so, he answered in the most honest, direct, and genuine manner. And that moment where someone tried to sort of get him, forget the question, he answered in such an adult way that it appeared foreign to many politicians. He said essentially that he would talk to them (them being representatives trying to impose new regulations). Talk to them and figure it out together. Try to understand why they wanted this or that. You know...like a fucking adult.
It's easy to answer questions when you've got nothing to hide and the facts support you.
How bout Melvin who doesn't even know how to fake that he's not reading right off a script?  Look at the camera man.

Basic zooming 101.
I'm no expert in legal proceedings, but in my limited experience, I feel like the people carefully reading scripts and avoiding direct answers when probed for one, are the party at fault and are needing to desperately make sure they don't say anything that can incriminate them.

Dfv has no need to lie or deceive because he's operated well within his rights and simply needs to recount good events as they happened.
It’s easy to be calm and tell the truth when you did nothing wrong. The rest of those guys know they can ruin their lives if the law interprets their answers as damning.
They should give DFV a fucking chair, honestly.
Their executive positions have been a revolving door for years.
Only so much they can do
Yeah for real. That was very encouraging
Ex AWS engineers? Competent as fuck executives?

There's no memes about it - that company is worth investing in regardless of the hype.
And yet GME still down 11% today :(
Ah, the elevator pitch... I went to film school and this concept was driven into our heads constantly.  We need to be able to explain our vision for a project in the time it takes to ride an elevator.  If you couldn’t do that you either didn’t understand your own project, or it had gotten far too large and needs to be trimmed down.
The how/strategy/plan is a glaring omission from this statement.
Isnt this just the cohen letter mission statement for a new gme?
Send over some recommendations for those books!
It looks like the last chance for shorts to bottom the price and wait for a miracle (people selling their shares). I highly doubt this will work. We are diamond handing this, buying more and holding no matter what. In fact I think this is creating a bigger and dangeours blackhole for the HFs and the whole financial system. We will see.
I like the stock.
MVP
Put the bandana on the Fearless Girl in front of the WS Bull.
And them asking the hedges for fucking advice I can't even what the fuck
It is, much more. And much more honest.
I’m sure they didn’t realize how intelligent he would be!
He has been 20 steps ahead of everyone the whole time
Eh, congressmen are not smart, they are just good at politics. Same as an electrician, a computer scientist or a biologist. They are just trained/experienced to do what they do.
that's not him he's not a cat
I do too. I buy all Nintendo games physically. It beats BB, Walmart and Target because most employees actually enjoy working there and talking about the products.
Boomers didn't understand games forty years ago, they still don't understand them today. Hell, I'm an old millennial and I've lived through how those people said the internet and cell phones would never get anywhere. They gonna be wrong, one more time.
No they need to have an online store, with quality service, where you can ship to your nearest gamestop for free, or ship to your home for a reasonable fee with free returns at gamestop locations.
gamestop purchased thinkgeek with the idea that the stores could branch out and sell collectible nerd stuff, but it didn't work. in fact, it failed spectacularly enough that it ended up all but killing thinkgeek.
True.  You want a game that was released two weeks ago?  Tough shit, you waited too long.
Found Mr Wonderful
Why would that be a mistake?
They are doing the absolute smartest thing. There isn’t possibly a better spokesperson than DFV
I am not a cat.

Keith Fucking Gill!
Exactly, a good online hardware seller is still to come. And it could be VERY easy to GME to achieve that now. No matter if you buy your games on Steam: you gonna need a hardwared to use it, no matter what kind (PC, Consoles, VR...).
And right now, to buy that hardware sucks, there is where GME can make a HUGE difference now.
No, he thinks they have a future in the digital space.
Would you still work with $15million+ in the bank?
But today's hearing did hurt the stock value, any thoughts on if the hearing pushed the possibility of them having to cover there shorts? Sorry I'm a retard and nothing ever made sense.
When DeepValue sells he'll be richer than Gamestop's CEO
This is the type of investment strategy that will prove that we at WSB are too retarded to manipulate any sort of market. That being said, I still hold GME from $298.
He’s gonna end up being in the game stop super bowl ad directed by spike jonez
It’d be the smartest thing Gstop ever did. They just might make it to the moon with this guy as their face.
If GameStop doesn't hire him, I still like the stock.

But if GameStop does hire him, then I also still like the stock.
Best they can pay him is $5.00 unfortunately.
Dude I absolutely lost it when I heard that, made me stay for the whole hearing
He is my hero
Same here (no homo) DFV was great!
He did a business
He could be an Evil Cat Doctor in disguise.
It's what a cat would say.
Cats don't answer to your god
I like the way you spell
Fellow Canadian?
Educated in a member state of The Commonwealth of Nations
I would've, too, but you can't deny that much of his appearance and speaking time today was very calculated. To the unknowing congressman, he appeared to just be a regular dude in his basement, but to us, everything from the hanging bandana, the poster, and the references to "I like the stock," "I'm not a cat," "stonk," and so forth were an awesome nod to us as a whole.
Or wore the headband as a cravat instead of a tie.
They better
For scale
I'm still in.
Not to mention he shared all of his analysis for free online for anyone to read and interpret. He's the real robinhood, sinking hours and hours studying just to give it away to others in case they find it useful or interesting. He got himself stuck in a congressional hearing for it, being on the hot seat for just a personal investment choice.

Meanwhile Vlad looking like a defunct beatles fan who has a speech impediment, eating his own words every other sentence.
Simple.  Who wants to carry a big fucking bag of dog food from the car to the house?  No one.  Boom.  Dog food delivery.
Chewy is amazing me I never thought they would do so well.
And being in a smaller industry has been grossly beneficial. GameStop isn't in the same sort of untapped market situation.
That's a great quote
And yet the big companies are so concerned with profits that they keep churning out unfinished garbage
They just have to position themselves to compete with steam or blizzard or something like that cause right now their taking the bread
In a time after covid. People are gonna want to go do fun shit man. Any business that has music, alcohol, decent food and video games will fuckin bank

Edit: BRB going to buy calls on Dave n busters
Hosting LAN parties would be such a cool use of their position with brick and mortar everywhere.
Sell fucking alcohol too. All us kids are grown the fuck up now. The 38% of gamers are in their 20's and 30s
GME/AMC merger when
Gamestop should be looking at Australia to see why EBGames is still dominating retail.
Not trying to rain on anyone's parade but;

     Two hour delivery of anything in stock so you can keep gaming 

Even if this was logistically feasible (my 20 years of retail experience tells me its probably not.) I can already download anything i want pretty much instantly, game wise. Hardware wise its always cheaper to get it online and most places deliver like next day.

&#x200B;

>Host gaming competitions, both professional and amateur. Esports are growing at 9% annually

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You cant just host a professional esport competition. That's like saying they should just host an NBA game. That's not how it works. Valve isnt going to hold a CSGO major (or minor) in a random gamestop somewhere. esports are tightly controlled "leagues" with a specific schedule and locations played in stadiums. And no one cares about amateur esports (this is coming from someone who actually watches esports BTW).

&#x200B;

>Host weekly LAN parties where you can play the latest games on the latest hardware. Rent this space for private parties and meetups

&#x200B;

this has been tried in pretty much every city since Quake was the biggest game out there. It never ever works because people dont actually want this. the reason gaming is a huge industry is because you can do it from home. Nobody wants to drive across the city to go to a random place with a bunch of strangers to play games when you could do the exact same thing from the comfort of your own home. Thats why consoles killed arcades 30 years ago. There has been at least 3 attempts at a place like this in my city. They all disappeared in like a year.

&#x200B;

>Host retro gaming/retro PC swap meets and meetups

&#x200B;

I mean, ok. Sure. This wont even pay the lease on the building tough.

&#x200B;

>Buy all the old Sears and turn them into VR arcades/theme parks

&#x200B;

That would be an insanely expensive investment for something that, again, most people dont want.
I'M RECLAIMING MY TIME!!!

Yea, if they aren't trying to hire DFV for something - ANYTHING - they're doing shit wrong.

New GameStop commercial:

Focus in on local GameStop, lightly populated, full shelves.

Enter DeepFUCKINGValue

DFV approaches employee casually. Looks around. "You've got a nice stock here. I like it. Be a shame if something happened to it."

DFV suddenly makes it fucking rain with his millions of dollars.

Cut to the aftermath. GameStop shelves empty.

Its so good for them that they were too paralyzed by fear of regulatory smack down because of this whole thing to be able to do an offering to clear debt
Dudes a millionaire I can’t imagine he wants to work on the board of a mid level company
The current CEO has been awfully quiet this whole time, hasn’t he?
Questions I want answers to:

Who the fuck was it that didn't have their mic muted though? 

What clown was running the meeting that wasn't muting the mics of anyone not actively speaking?
Lol billionairs had ikea chairs
Honestly they lucked out having the pandemic happening now. Imagine them having to free ball these questions in front of a senate committee.
I feel like someone was live typing the answers and he was reading that.
I'll bet there would have been value in their names as well.  How many former SEC people in the room with him and why?
Yeah it’s bc that is their skill set. Being a politician your skill is literally bullshitting. So they’re great at it. 

Humans can only have so many skills. If you’re great at 1 thing you’re lucky.
I once met a congressman who said the dumbest thing ever and walked out realizing what you just said. It was my only time in DC. I know some of them know a lot more than I do about a lot of stuff. But...They're not these incredible people we sort of think they are by default because of their positions.
I used to work with a guy that owns a farm on the side. I don’t really understand it, but he like originated grain futures with his actual grain and then traded grain futures like crazy. He said he made more on trading, but had the land, so he might as well use it. Dude taught me a ton of shit and got me into options in the first place. Most down to earth dude I ever met.
We need to vote with our shares to get him on the board.
His gamer chair seems comfortable though

It's one of the rare careers where you'll be a 20 year old with a couple of stripes briefing anyone and everyone up to Generals and their civilian equivalents. No pressure, eh?

You may only have 2-3 minutes to explain a situation that has been building for days/weeks/months. Then comes question time.

I was terrified of public speaking before I joined. USAF training that fear out of me is a gift I'll never forget.
Me too, but also I felt that was everything that had gone wrong with cinema. I’m cool with loglines and everything, but try explaining Tarkovsky, Fellini or Kubrick in an elevator? Those kind of film studio execs are the Melvins of cinema. Scorsese wrote a great piece the other day on ‘content’ vs cinema.
I was hired as a copier/plotter salesman by a customer of the bar I was managing.  The guy that hired me was straight out of Glengarry Glen Ross.  He put the staff through a lunch hour "university" to learn everything about the industry and most importantly selling.  He would go out on calls and literally make us do an elevator pitch, in the elevator, on our way to cold call entire office buildings.  The guy was relentless.  I miss ole Doug.  I don't miss that job.  Fuck that job.
The short "how" part is separate from the elevator pitch. I think there are 5 speeches a leader is supposed to have on deck at all times. The elevator pitch, the how, why, history, and I think 5 is where you're going. But I'm not sure if that's right or part of the others....
I'mhodling.
oops bought more instead....avg down, right?
Question: is the strategy of the shorts/hedgefunds to keep paying the 'late fine' for not delivering the stocks until the stockprice drops to something really low?
She got moved because they thought that she made the bull look bad, they didn't like the "common person vs Wall Street giants" vibe.
How can they not see the gaming industry continuing to grow.   I used to hate on my brother for letting his son play games on iPads all day.   And here I am with my 3 year old playing games on my iPad.   Anyone with kids or grand kids can see this.   I work in a restaurant and every kid that comes in with their family same thing playing games.   

Before this whole GME thing happened I can’t tell you how many times I’ve bought gift certificates from games stop because that’s all my nephews wanted.   It’s only a matter of time until my kids are getting GameStop gift cards for every holiday.
one more time seems optimistic
Except this time...

*It's gonna cost them their mutual funds.*
Their online sales are up 300% YOY and already make up about a quarter of their sales.

And that was before Ryan Cohen, before they added a guy who made AMZN what it is today, before they added some people that made CHWY what it is today. I sold some on the way down from 350 to 90 after buying in at $37. I'll be buying in again this week.
They should also franchise globally. The brank recognition is through the roofs across the globe.
They still sell a shit ton of merch through their stores, I think it's a viable market but they'll have to get something creative done to take advantage of competing in merch.

I mean Gamestop could probably sell at cons and make a metric fuck ton of money but they'd have to adopt a guerilla convention system that uses staff from local stores
They did a piss poor job of integrating thinkgeek.

I made a killing off their massive clearance because people like what they had to offer just they did a piss poor job at advertising and keeping stuff at high prices.
Yep!
Jokes on you, true ape will trade those 15mil for magic beans instead of leaving  them in the bank unused.
If it's a job you enjoy then sure
For GameStop commercial money, hell yeah
The first group of people that come to mind are ex-NFL and ex-NBA stars that became commentators and stick around for more than 2 seasons. I'm pretty sure every one of them is worth more than $15mm.
Was talking about this the other day with friends.

Literally no matter how vast a fortune I have/inherit would stop me working.

However, I certainly wouldn’t be busting my ass. I’d just get a nice part time job, or open my own bar or something. Do all the easy work/socialise and hire people to make the rest work.
no.. i'll trade with 5 mill tho
... A) though that is multiple times the average lifetime earnings of the average American it still isn't very much
B) if you're offered a half million a year plus to be a talking head or some such you'd be stupid to refuse unless you'd make more another way (and as reliably). Earning >3% of your total wealth on top of any earnings from the investment of said wealth sounds smart to me...
Yes, but the advantage is that you have power in arguments, thus making work easier.
Yes, but I like my job so probably not the same situation. I want my pension after all the years of working, you know?

However, I would live more comfortably *right now* knowing that money would not be a problem. Pay off the credit cards, car, house, etc, and just live how I want.
If I had that kind of money I would absolutely love to have the opportunity to do a job like that and push a company I like in the right direction. I would especially enjoy my job if I knew I didn't depend on it for survival
I was discussing this with some mates. When this goes to the moon, I will continue working at my current job and continue to work for at least the next ten years with the peace of mind knowing my tendies are secured. I have my reasons as I'm sure many apes do too, but that's what I'm going to do.
I've thought about this and yea. I'd work part time in a yacht yard somewhere. I'd get the structure and workout that people end up getting depressed when they don't have; I get to work on boats, which I love; and I get to work in a polo, khakis, and boat shoes, as opposed to steel toed boots and coveralls.
Why not? Gotta do something with your time.
How else can you afford the big yacht

When all the subscription box craze started, before ever knowing about chewy, I had the same idea.
Players are so bored theyre buying unfinished garbage
And then some indie game comes out and millions buy and play it.
I could see Gamestop becoming an Amazon/ steam mash up. They would have digital game downloads, forums, physical game systems and PC parts/ builds and also physical gaming paraphernalia (chairs, posters, shit even food delivery, etc). All in one place with Amazon like shipping and service. Individual sellers backed by Gamestop with buyer protection and all that shit. You just don't hire the kind of people they've been hiring just to go under.

edit also a bit of OG Radioshack, and table top games (which are now cool)
Maybe not even just video games. The overlap between table gamers and PC gamers is pretty big, so they could have game libraries. People won't come into a store just to buy something, so you have to give them a reason and hook them with impulse purchases.

They also own ThinkGeek, which is basically Hot Topic for nerds. With all the [cheap retail space that will be available](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/18/next-economic-crisis-empty-retail-space-429994) they could offer an experience tailored to gamers and geeks, and space to share their hobby, and let them buy all the weird crap their nerdy hearts desire.

Hell, maybe they could even open maker spaces and become what Radio Shack should have been.
And 71% of us have chronic alcoholism.

Bro. Someone needs to contact him and sell merchandise. I swear I'd buy anything that resembles DFV I want a bobble head to put on my desk so that I can have him agree with my gambling choices.. I mean investment.
They should hire him as an evangelist.

I think some of the background noise sometimes came from congresswoman waters shortly after someone’s 5 minutes started and shortly before it expired so she can bang the gavel. I don’t know if someone else was muting for her or not, because I know someone else fixed her technical difficulty when she had one, so who knows lol.

427th floor? You live in the wiz khalifa?
Def agree with you here , but that’s the difference between a truly great auteur and everyone else, they just operate at a different level.
Tarkovski’s Stalker - a philosophical adventure tale about a group willing to put their lives on the line to reach the mysterious “zone” at the chance of being granted a wish.

Kubrick’s clockwork orange - a gritty, surreal story of a punk, after committing one too many heinous acts, is caught and attempted to be rehabilitated. But whether it’s the person or society, is rehabilitation possible for someone like that?

Just two examples. But just condensing your overall story down into an interesting bite to catch a big fish isn’t like the end all destruction of art. Time is money, you gotta know what you’re selling and who you’re selling it to. (Source: have pitched tv shows)
And me, my friend. More confident than ever.
I think so. Fails to deliver and bottom the price as much as possible. A very bad move IMHO. They could have rip the bandaid off long ago... instead, they are making it much worse for themselves and for the whole system.
This will probably lead to a VW scheme, where HFs risks to a big move in the low prices... the kind of movement you cant't simply avoid anymore.
That's lame. Bunch of snowflakes.

My mind went straight to Tom from MySpace and Zuckerberg. I like Tom. I also like to believe that if any of us apes ever got super wealthy we would do something positive for the world instead of hoarding more wealth and power.
You're pretty sure they haven't blown most of their money huh
 Yeah that's kind of what I meant. I invest cos I don't want to work for someone, to have expectations and demands. Nobody wants to sit around and do nothing, shit I make spreadsheets for like 3 different hobbies. 

 I'd work creating stuff off my own back, or with other people. And if one day I didn't feel like working, I'd just take the day and pick up when I felt like it
You should look into Jimmy Liautaud, founder of Jimmy John’s. He almost didn’t become a huge chain by taking all the easy work/easy schedules. It took an employee to call him out and quit for him to realize he had to do all the hard work and hard shifts if he wanted his company to succeed, it was really interesting hearing about it.
$15mil in the bank is enough to take out $600,000 per year and have it last indefinitely, if you invest boringly (so not like anyone here).  Yeah, would be dumb to turn down essentially free money if gamestop wants to hire him to be a talking head or whatever, but that income alone puts you in the 1% of USA earners.  

Importantly, this is well beyond what he's claimed to make prior to this ($100,000), so he can be done if he wants to and fuck off doing whatever until he dies.
You mentioned something that looks like crypto. We get it, crypto is neat, but it's not our thing. [(Rule 4)](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules)

Ya that's the one. I guess a cravat is a tie...
I always feel a little bad when I order cat litter every few months. I'm sure my ups guy looks at our chewy boxes with disdain.
Always felt bad for you guys when the order was to package another 5 kg of dog food ontop of the 25 kg bag already crammed into the box.
This is actually the reason I’ve been resisting ordering from chewy. I don’t want to subject our delivery drivers to a 40 lb bag they have to lug up to my door.  I’d actually like to set up a subscription and save the few bucks but I just can’t do it.
I honestly don't understand how people buy so many games. I play the same game for 2 years until I'm tired of it.
They could probably try to save a lot of the indie failing game shops too and basically sponsor them. Split the cash and let passionate locals run it with minimal corporate oversight.
That's no way to talk about our hobbies
Hell yeah we can.  We got the shares, we get to vote on the board.
Uh. Aren't the majority of shares held by companies?
Quick, someone call the makers of UNO, I've got a great marketing play!
There were 3 or 4 points during the introductions/opening statements where someone was in the background making noise/rustling around.  Right near the start there was also clearly people talking in the background and laughing.  Probably a bit hypersensitive as it's now been a year of non stop webex meetings but that was some BUSH LEAGUE teleconference etiquette right there.
Of course not. You get the government to pay for it.
The difference between that and having an entire team writing you a script is staggering though
You mean the Burj Cauliflower
I recognise it works for expressing a theme, like Paddy Chayefsky: “As soon as I figure out what the theme of my play is, I type it out in one line and Scotch-tape it to the front of my typewriter. After that, nothing goes into the play that is not on-theme.” 

I get why it is the mantra of screenwriters, and helps with the writing process as much as in pitching; it helps more than it hurts. 

I stand by what I said, I’m cool with log-lines, like your examples, but none of those films were elevator pitched, they were fought for by auters. It was a mountain climbed, not an elevator ride spent with an exec, the true scope of great cinema cannot be expressed in a paragraph, or an elevator. It is the unsayable which makes the medium separate. Dreams emerge in the mirage of moving light, that’s where the soul of cinema lies. It’s not in words. 

I suppose being around so many who have studied and worked in screenwriting, etc. It’s one of those guru commandments, which presupposes that you already have what it takes to write or produce great cinema. 

I think I am quite influenced by my recent feelings reading Scorcese’s comment on modern content creation as opposed to true ‘cinema’ https://harpers.org/archive/2021/03/il-maestro-federico-fellini-martin-scorsese/

Truth. I’d pay for urgent and critical dog surgeries and upgrade shelters with better trained staff, better resources for adoption and to give the puppers their best lives.

Haha, I think you’re misunderstanding. The initial comment said if you can’t give someone the general vision in under a minute- YOU don’t fully understand your own script. Or maybe you have all these different tentacles you want to talk someone’s ear off about, but you’re not focused on WHAT your story truly is. We’re not talking about the writing of the script, or any of the artistry behind being an auteur. But you’re out of your mind if you don’t think almost every major director/filmmaker had to secure funding at some point or another, and to get that person/entity to even hear the nitty gritty and be stoked on your idea, you’ve gotta sell them on the elevator pitch. 

Stupid example, but here: You had a crazy night last night. Instead of going yo, dude, lemme tell you about last night, and then you ramble on for 20 minutes giving them every detail while they try not to look at their phone. Or. You go, dude, did I tell you about how I drunkenly lost my wallet, crashed my car, but somehow still got laid? Now your friend is like wait, WHAT tell me more.

Your story never changes. But now your friend wants to hear the whole story bc you sold them on an interesting blurb first.

I mean it's literally what Cohen is doing. As much as DFV believes in the stock and Cohen, if he were given that offer *by* Cohen (or at least the office of the CEO. Proxy and delegation, etc) to do the same and actually build their vision? For sure he would do that. He loves the stock.
I would pay to build a dog launcher that I would bait with treats. A dogapult. I figure that if it's large enough I can fire them at least a block. But to be fair I would also do cats. I don't know what I would call it if I did cats.
I would dump money into the school system where I grew up.
Fuck yeah bud, that’s basically my dream too. 

People are shit. Dogs aren’t.
Yeah but as the saying goes, the more you make, the more you spend. A lot of those dudes lives arent sustainable without some sort of income.
I feel like Reddit and GME could hash out some sort of voting system for a collective vote owned by the shareholders who indicate on their shares that they are part of that voting process. It probably wouldn't effect anything (INB4 REDDIT EFFECTS GAMESTOP AS A TYING VOTE) major but it would be an awesome mechanism to incentivize ownership
You can send a proxy vote out to users.
You had it right the first time. Can't be the Mia Khalifa because that one only goes down

I don’t think I said anything which disagreed with you regarding that, or misunderstood which part of filmmaking you were talking about. I think if anything I understood and supported it, I mean Paddy started with a single line taped to his typewriter, what’s more streamlined than that. 

When I said they had to fight and climb a mountain, I meant that with securing funding more than anything. Riskier and more creative filmmakers beg for money more than anyone after all. 

I have elevator pitched to top studio heads and execs, I really do recognise the necessity in the filmmaking process. I actually enjoy writing loglines, and reducing structure into treatments and pitches. If I don’t I can struggle to structure a story coherently, without redundancy.

I think your example is a false equivalency insofar as I was just talking about some of the cinematic treasures of human history, not dull, incoherent ramblings and redundant plot points. 

I’m more talking about guru advice and the disconnect between content and cinema, business and art in the practices it promotes, and emphasis it places on marketability at the expense of creativity and pushing cinema towards. Of course no matter how good a log line is, and yes plot has primacy (I am a disciple of Aristotle’s Poetics can you tell), it is no substitute for craft and greater artistry, without which you are dead in the water.
I like the skeeball!

At this point I feel like he loves the company as much as the stock.
Take half my money for this too, plz.
I would buy it, tear it down and build a gladiator arena. In the coming era kids would be better served learning to mush chariots and behead tigers then learning math
It would also open both up to the liability of the SEC crawling up our collective asses every 15 minutes. 

I like the current situation and I like the stonk.
I mean I do too. I almost bought three shares of GME back when it was $22 just because I liked GameStop and wanted that little bit of nostalgia. All this sort of gives me a validation in my gut feeling I had that day like I'm sure DFV had when Cohen came on so I'm still definitely interested in getting in once the hype volatility settles a little more.
Ugh you're not wrong

I like stonk too, regardless company is going up
One thing redditors are also good at doing, is due diligence, and data scraping.  Do the hedge-funds REALLY want to investigate retards and autists who feel sleighted to the point where they can gather so much data they'll incriminate EVERY bank CEO for money laundering, insider-trading, arms-dealing, and paedophilia? I think not. Politicians and Bankers would be scurrying for their tax-havens/non-extradition countries before the end of the first day of hearings, if they get too aggressive.  

The hedge-funds KNOW that they got caught with their pants down, and they're trying to pin it on redditor autist retards, but they ought to be careful. Push too hard, and they'll get ROYALLY fucked.  

Keith Gill is safe. He's playing nice, answering the questions, and not rocking the boat too much. Give the crowd a few laughs, hedge-funds feel like they won, because they put someone in front of a hearing.  The SEC doesn't care, because, it's all political theater. 

I say, let the SEC bring it. It won't end well for their backers.

TEXT: He was just participating in the drank game with everyone
probably kombucha
He looks like he spends all day staring at reddit
Looks like a glass of Melvins tears.
I want to see DFV lighting up a fatty.
The hair is good, I'll give him that one.
Every-time they say 'GameStock" he drinks another beer
Its a party drinking game and he needed to take sip.
Def his wife's bf's urine
He was drinking when they started too lol
Calls on whatever fucking brewery that is.
Is this the guy on r/wallstreetbets logo?
Something is off with his eyes tho. One robo the other normal. No?
He is one of the best at fielding questions. But he kept licking his front teeth. I was like... bro. You on coke?
I just like the stock, CHEERS!
DFV said cheers so he had to drink to it.
Shiii. That’s a blue moon because that’s where we are going!
Cocaine eyes if I have ever seen them...not from experience or anything...
That looks like a thicc IPA.  Like drinking hoppy syrup.
I’m pretty sure that’s a glass of piss
Maybe it’s just the picture, but he doesn’t look well.
Why does the Reddit ceo look like a psychopath
One of his eyes is huge
This picture was taken seconds before his right eye popped
I think you're on mute  


\*Drinks\*
Pretty sure that's high-yield decorative gourd juice.
Man was about to rip his eye and throw it to the screen
We truly live in a meme-based economy
why the fuck is his eye trying to pop out of his head!?
This guy's eyes look like my stock picks
Does he have a glass eye (right)?
Fuck spez, that guy sucks dick a mile long
Spez is a cuck
That handsome fucker rules all us degens?  Shocked forreal.
We're going to make believe spez is a good person now? His company is being attacked and labeled as Nazis of course he's going to defend against that, that's its own money and reputation on the line. The bar is so low that anyone who's willing to utter the truth becomes a deity. Sad.
Fuck this guy
This dude is a grade A cuck.
Anyone else find the way he holds the glass as odd.
Sure looks like water.
Mark Zuckerberg PTSD
Nah still a piece of shit
He looks like a gay version of Ronan Farrow
CEO of Censorship
Yo spez sucks what is this dumb propaganda
Fuck Spez
Why exactly is the CEO of reddit being celebrated? All he did was try to cover his ass all day by repeating over and over that there were zero bots on r/wallstreetbets.
If he's reading this: you fuck sir.
why do people like spez? he abused his power by editing comments. banned a sub because of fake reasons while letting other subs exist that actually promote violence. 

the moment spez finds out anyone here doesn’t share his ideology he’ll ban the sub. 

what happened to people being upset about that mod not being allowed to moderate here anymore? is everyone a lap dog now? shame.
CEO of censorship too
fuck this guy, actively making this site less funny
fuck him. 

Long live Aaron Swartz.
Cheersing (toasting) DFV with Roaring Kitty IPA

Edit - my uncultured self
Jesus fuck. Spez is not your friend retards. Fuck this guy.
He was a fricken G out there
Fuck Spez
Oh god let’s please not start sucking this guys cock.
Haha did you see my comment a few hours ago?
That drank do look good.
He looks high af
Man looks like he hasn't slept in days
Nahh he's toasting to DFV. DFV used to sip on beer during his live streams on YouTube.
By the looks of his right eye the drip is hitting him bad
Reddit has a CEO?
cover half his face with your finger. it’s a different person each side
That’s pee.
Dude is staring into my soul, oh wait that's just how you identify a redditor. He knows things boy's, terrible terrible things.
His eyeballs look like someone photoshopped them in.
Why are we praising this guy lmao
Eh fuck him, Reddit is a shell of what it used to be, it might as well be Facebook at this point.
Spez is a massive cuck.
Fuck u/spez
Dude looks like a lizard person
The simping for spez is disgusting. Guy is a cunt. 
People need to stop paying for awards on this shithole site and lining his pocket.
Call me crazy but to me that looks like a Bloody Mary with a piece of okra or a pickle (green thing on the left). I damn well hope so. It’s now a personal goal to enjoy a hungover bloody while I respond to congressional questions of sanity and loss porn scrutiny
That foo faded af, thats y his left eye is smaller
O\_o
reddit should get an IPO
But for real, fuck /u/spez.
 
Should've been ousted after editing user's posts out of frustration.
IPA's are such trash. Please let's annihilate my taste buds for anything else.  Similar to Starbucks burnt coffee.
What the fuck is wrong with his eyes
That’s one giant cuck.
Fuck that guy
i know coke eyes when i see them
Lol! I was wondering if that was a beer! Epic move.
Hahaha noticed that!
he's playing the drink with Vlad talks game with us!!!
cheers everyone!
 Ever knew he looked like the WSB guy.
I feel like we all had to drink to get through a lot of that hearing.
Who loves orange soda?
Probably Kombucha
It's probably some horse piss Kombucha or something
Dudes eyes also look as red as the devils dick in this photo, Interview high, get high praise.
Definitely kombucha
Maybe because roaring kitty recommends grabbing a beer in his streams. Full of signals today.
I like my beers to taste gross.
Was he standing the whole time? Lmao
He and DFV weren’t reading from a TelePrompTer. You know they got nothing to hide or a question they needed to avoid.
Where will you be when the acid hits
This expression says, wtf how did I even end up here?
Nothing like a congressional hearing in setting the mood for some IPAs with the boys
That's Caprisun
Lol Bloody Mary mate
No wonder he answered the questions so well!!! HE WAS DRUNK FROM THE DRINKING GAME WAY INTO IT!!!
Man with all the beers I was drinking, a beer sounds nice right about now
Nah these guys have been into kambucha
I’m the only one that drinks grapefruit juice in this entire sub?
I guess with all those shitty ads on reddit he can afford to drink only IPAs
I’m not even sure it’s a beer. But even if it is. It’s a fucking beer. 

It doesn’t make him a boss. It’s nbd whatsoever. 

Are you all 17 and still think beer is “cool” rather than just a beverage that grown ass people drink. All the time. Not to get wasted or party - because they enjoy them. 

He might as well be drinking a coffee. It’s no different. 

Unless you’re someone who still laughs at the number 69. Jfc
He looks like he just pulled an all-weeker studying the shit out of wsb and finance law.

u/spez, you ok man. Enjoy that beer.
This is the proverbial jumping of the shark. This shit is over, everything is dogshit again.
u/spez what beer  you drinking?
I read this guy spent some cash on eye enhancement to survive the apocalypse?

This! My 2nd favorite part of the hearing, DFV in entirety being the first.
Definitely not an IPA
*proceeds to slurp harder than daddy zucc*
WSB haircut confirmed
Spez is a gay bear
Are his eyes shopped? Wtf is going on?
His glass eye was weirding me out the entire time.
Like a cuck you mean. He stands for anything but fairness and equality and is pro censorship.
Is that Rick Astley?  Did RH just rickroll Congress?
Guessing it's plain-ole juice.
Bruh he look so cokes out
Look into those eyes and tell me that you didn't turn gay cause of him.
Is that a bloody mary!?
Spez is a cuck.
Looks like an unfiltered wheat beer.
i saw him drink that at the beginning of the hearing.
He most certainly is not a fan of free speech here tho. No amount of hearing theater will change that.
Got the cocaine eyes
Does he look strung out to anyone else?
He did a great job.
Cool but fuck Spez
Jesus, he looks a character from a movie who turns out to be a demon.
u/Spez

My mans looks like he’s washing down that coke drip
Spez is a cuck.
I saw that and I thought “beer” lol but in a good way bc his testimony was BOSS and he didn’t inhale his ballsack into his own taint and completely and utterly backed Reddit members, not only with his personal statements but also with DATA. I was very impressed and just felt so enamored with my time invested on this platform. Everyday it is more a blessing to be here with you guys.
He's  wearing an orange tie and drinking water.
/u/spez shed some light?
I was waiting for the “AHHHHHH” after a sip.
Can we talk about how he was shown standing the entire time
Was he trying to do the WSB logo guy hair?
I see they have already started work on the WSB live action movie.  He needs his sunglasses though.
Special retard
This guy absolutely chadded his statement.
He was drinking it the whole time
The boys: alright alright, every time he Vlad says "I appreciate your question", we drink.

People talk about DFV being really succinct, but I was also impressed by Huffman's testimony. Kind of generic but he refuted the antisemitism claim pretty well, almost immediately after Melvin douche said it too
Wasn't he drinking everytime someone said "GAMESTOCK"????
I am glad that I am not the only one that caught that.
Fuck spez!

Remember Aaron Swartz!
Hey, it’s me, Steve.
Color is not too hoppy, my guess is wheat ale.
Well DFV said the thing.
Like a what? Is any of this real anymore?
That’s a Bloody Mary.
Is that TM next to RH supposed to be a joke?
Looks more like a Hefeweizen but I’ll take either.
Haha missed this moment. Love it! Big respect to him. He did a great job.
that stare feels like he's peering into my soul. Makes me want to confess to a crime i didn't commit.
That dude had great answers.
Had to wash them ludes down
Yes or no
bruh why does he look like that one pic of mark zuckerburg drinking water
Looks like fiber to me ...
Look at the cocaine in that mans eyes that mf been up for three days
Remember this man is as corrupt as it gets. They killed the Reddit cofounder.
Giving legislators [The Laaaazy Eye](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0WLCSHoc4ZM).
r/MildlyTerrifying
 /u/spez what’s the flavor?
Na that’s his apple juice lol.
Something about his eye on the left
Spez is a literal redditor
One eye is business other eye is all party
He drank everytime Vlad said "appreciate"
That's how I drink my greyhounds. In a pint glass.
On top of the 8 ball he snorted a few sleepless days ago.

Seriously though, DFV all the way!
Dude did ok.
The guy who censors conservatives for a living? He’s a total POS
Respect for backing up the communities. That said this man looks like he'd pay homeless people to beat them up.
he's a scumsucking douchebag whose conduct regarding The\_Donald was CRIMINAL
Isn't Reddit CCP invented?
He’s hot omg
Steve Huffman is the freakin Mack!  Love him!!!
Spez is a cuck
[removed]
SALUT
IPA?
My mans testimony was gold. As was DFV’s.
One of his eyes is bigger then the other, so his face just looks kinda weird and interesting at the same time.
I see most users on here don’t know the corrupt backstory behind Spez..
Yeah he’s still a giant fucking pussy.
Ballmers Peak
 he’s a bitch tho.
Spez is a cuck.
To hell with spez. He will censor you faster than Robin hood
What a magnificent bastard
Give him some sunglasses and.....
Spaz drinking beer is such a nod to deep f****** value because he's always drinking beer in his videos
That is some HEAVY eye contact.
He drinks his old piss cups too!?
He was exemplary, and reinforced my confidence in this platform.
I've quit all social media accept for Reddit a few years ago, and the only thing that made me stick with Reddit was the ability to vet bullshit and streamline my experience with the unique subreddits.
The voting system may be flawed, or games, but it's average metrics are consistent, and reliable.

I feel like he was the only CEO at the hearing who actually gave a shit about his  clients.
He basically said, reddit followed all the site guidelines and that we're proud of the community we have.

Baller responses by him today.
I hope he burned that suit after the hearing.
It looked like blue moon to me jajaja
Fuck that douchebag.
I feel like that dude could look into my soul with his eyes
Definitely a ballast point sculpin
Boy look high asf
nah, fuck him and those jannie eyes
LEGEND
A fuckin CHAD
Glass of winning
Spez is a scumbag, i hope his place doesnt start sucking his tiny dick
Are we really giving Spez props right now? The dude is a shit bird.
Why do all rich people have one weird eye though?
The CEO of Reddit looks like the sort of pussy bitch you'd expect the CEO of Reddit to look like.
Along with DFV, he seems to be the only one not filibustering
That’s kombucha u uncultured swine.
My nigggggggggga
I’m sorry. But if I were him vs. Maxine Waters, I would have been drinking bourbon.
How long before he’s not allowed near schools?
I think this guy might be a white walker from GOT.
I thought wsb hated spez
This guy is a loser. Stop astroturfing
That's actually just bloody jizz. Remember who this guy is. /u/BloodyJizzDrinker77. Fuck him.
Looked more like a bloody Mary
He’s drinking upvotes
Was hoping DFV would get his magic 8 ball out to answer some questions for them
Cheers
That was an ode to the great DFV.
GameStock!
/u/spez tell uss
Devils triangle?
That’s actually a good assessment. He is as probably doing that as a low key what’s up to the sub. That’d be cool
I thought that was a hazy IPA! Lol the delay of the cutoff led to some pretty priceless moments.  Like the first white haired congressman with glasses that was leading with Maxine cracking a smile when DFV and Gabe got questioned together and the congressman speaking to them made it clear through questioning that DFV basically owned Gabe
San Francisco, one of the founders of reddit?

I was thinking the same, or maybe some tumeric and carrot cold pressed drink that costs $30 a quart.

That or an IPA with 3 xanax and an adderall in it
Came here to say this. The good shit!
Adrenochromes from missing redditors.
It’s actually his own piss. Close though.
I'm picturing him like the architect in the matrix but instead of TVs it's just a bunch computer screens scrolling through reddit
But only with his right eye.
Spez is actually good looking? Was expecting the leader of Reddit to be a neckbeard like the rest of us
[removed]
He looks high Af
Not fat enough
Ah yes, *the look*.
That would be hell on earth. I have such a love/hate relationship with reddit
He looks like he spends all day staring at hookers and blow.

Oh wait, no, that's DFV.
Hey, I do *NOT* look like that.
Melvin needs to see a doctor ASAP.
Surprised to see Melvin CEO still has power. Must have gotten an advance on next weeks allowance from his wife’s boyfriend.
So funny.  
Doubting grandpa Melvin would approve of grandson shorting stock with other people’s money.  Maybe those are tears of guilt.
Massachusetts is a legal state. He could totes pull that off.
Smoking that Melvin pack
Grooming award def goes to Mr. Reddit.
Def has a good hair day, flow was on point
what's it called?
Impressively he looks better than I  expected from a ultimate Reddit user
Sure as shit better than Vlad’s haircut. Not sure who told him that looked good...
His competition was not exactly Fabio.
“Every time Ken Griffin lies take a drink”
"Thank you for that important question, congressman"
the logo is a baby from a random ass ted talk
I think its his wifes bf
he's watching us through the camera
One of my eyes is always a bit fucked for some reason. Just happens
many human's eyes are like that
He had laser eye surgery in 2017
Some people don’t have symmetrical faces

Source: i look like quasimodo when i get allergic reactions
He is a gecko. He had one eye on the meeting and the other on loss porn.
Cocain
Whenever I smoke weed, one of my eyes ALWAYS gets more red than the other. If I use Visene to clear the red eye, there's still some noticeable difference between the two eyes. This difference typically resolves T+1
Its your only hope of competing with Zuckerberg
Probably just nervous. Not everyday you have to protect yourself and your company in congress live
dudes eyes are glossy af doe..
Hopslam.
The newbies don't know this one
He is
It takes a psychopath to run this house of degenerates.
Lol what do you mean? What was he doing?
That's king degenerate right there
It is sad but that’s where the bar’s at right now.
Dude hired Elaine Pao as his successor. Not a good dude.
All these newbie normies haven’t seen what spez has done in the past.
Ya. Everyone seems to forget he literally edited people’s comments. Scary.
He spread the finger
With all the advances in modern science their kids would probably look like Woody Allen
That mod came back actually..but yeah, this spez guy doesn't seem like a great person from what I've seen.
In short, I like the stock.

Him and DFV seem to not be the only one filibustering.
...with Uno cards, too.
The 8-ball at least answers questions
Can you imagine what would have happened if he did it!
I'll drink to that
I am sure it is some awful Kombucha healthy mix drink.
I’m going with door number 3.
The Xanax comes in the evening. The adderal in the morning. The IPA is optional in that recipe. Consider it a garnish
A one way trip to blackout town, and maybe jail.
His skin is absolutely glowing though so I’d say you’re not far off.
Turmeric
Now I’m thirsty
Who would ruin their Adderall with Xanax?
And good for my shit
Fucking live off that shit. So good!
Ergo , visa vi
I imagine him more as the guy from south park that watches all of the toilet cams. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx2rgLt9gY8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx2rgLt9gY8)

Congressman, thank you for the question. \**sparks joint  - \*puts on headband*
The feds starts enforcing federal laws agains pot that very second.
Mass is a goddam commonwealth.
Congressman Lynch would probably call the Westgate Mall rent-a-cops on him.
I was blown away when I found out that DFV was practically my neighbor. When they were interviewing this fucking legend about his newfound millions, DFV said that he always wanted to build a nice park in Brockton, MA, for his daughter (because that's how much of a fucking Chad this dude is). No planes or Lambos, just thinking of his little girl and making his community a nicer place for everyone. If he does build that park, I'll gladly drive 50min down the road to visit Diamond Hands Park. I'll spend all day there, just enjoying the sunshine, knowing that this park is a slap in the face to Gabe Plotkin, Citadel, Melvin and all of those assholes who wouldn't have built a damn thing for anyone.

Terminator like.
One of mine doesnt close as much as the other. Pretty common trait relatively
Yes I am human and my eyes are not unsimilar.
What about non humans?
When I want to go get laser eye surgery, I think, "where did that Reddit guy go?" and then I do not do that thing.
That's adorable
the former ceo of reddit did not fucking smoke weed before testifying before a congressional committee, lmfao
That's what the coke is for... You're 100× more confident in all your statements.
Seriously I'm a lawyer and I hope most people dont mistake my nervousness as being on coke or some other drug lol
when you know tards are out there, doing this....
Both him and Ken Griffin have looked like they’ve been hostages all afternoon.
What’s so hard about it? Just read off your teleprompter
Negative ghost rider, he was licking his lips in anticipation of taking a sip from a delicious pint of victory.
Right?? Lol he's been caught editing comments to get subreddits banned. Legit piece of shit.
he also deep in china's pockets.  but look at great man drink beer ooooohhhh
What the fuck that's literally the plot of 1984
In short, I like the bot
“Why did you buy GME!”

“I liked the stock! Why did you short Norwegian Cruise Lines after a COVID briefing in February?”
yes!
Yes or No
Answers them better than Tenev anyway
as someone who reluctantly enjoys hard kombucha but HATES regular kombucha i need to step in. flying embers (ancient berry) is the shiiiizzzzz
He does. I tagged spez in a /r/conspiracy comment about reddit stealing peoples information and was instantly banned from the sub for tagging him. they wouldn't even accept my sincerest apologies and promises not to do it again.
We call it the "Silicon Valley Candyflip"
Concordantly
I think you have your founders mixed up...
You’re thinking of another co-founder, Alexis Ohanian. Different guy.
I'm sorry, did you mean ass tears or ass tears?
They still need to see a doctor if their ass is creating that amount of tears with such liquidity, proly will dehydrate really soon.
Tank all our weed stocks
And we're a fucking legal commonwealth goddamnit

I have that too. It's my "wonk" eye. If Bezos the richest man in the world can't get his fixed then I guess I live with mine.
INDEED, FELLOW HUMAN, OCCASIONAL EYE DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN OUR OTHER FELLOW HUMANS CAN BE CONSIDERED STANDARD OPERATING PROCEEDURE. AT LEAST OUR HANDS REMAIN HEAVILY COMPRESSED CARBON.
No no, he had the one where they install a laser eye. It's great.
Agreed, the idea is preposterous.

Everybody knows you do a nice fat rail before taking to Congress.
Have the staff write cue cards, then get fukin' lit. Sounds like a great, low stress day
Yeah, it's cocaine.

Christmas Eve, I snuck out of bed to get more of Mother's strudel even though she told me I couldn't have any more. I didn't care. I wanted more. When I got there, I saw that Krampus had beat me to it. He was neck-deep in Mutter's strudel. So I trapped him in that copper pot. Copper-potted him good. And that's why you and all the other baddies never get a visit from Krampus on Christmas Eve.
YES it's incredible
I've already brought the Xanax and adderal. Perhaps you can bring the acid. Did I mention this a potluck?
Not macro? Smh
True. I’m tearing one out now in tears. Tear gas is no joke
Yep bought more aphria sub 20$
Yeah, we don't need help tanking our weed stocks. We can do that fine on our own, thanks.
I wanna see a reply with proof
Hang in there
Best I can do is bath salts with shake and bake.

I like the bot
TITLE: He got trapped!!TEXT: A summary of today’s hearing was “thank you for your question”.
Thanks for the question, I appreciate it, I will continue to say nothing for a few minutes and completely avoid your questions. I truly thank you for taking your time to ask that question, unfortunately I cannot go into that right now because you are out of time.
“We certainly arnt public..... I’m sorry perfect.”

Hahaha he subconsciously knows that his IPO would be a bag of steaming shit after his shenanigans!
Makes me feel optimistic about being a CEO one day if this potato can
What’s your weaknesses?

Uhh.. I work too hard.
Did he commit perjury by telling lies about notify users? At market open, buy was disable without any notification
“Thank you for the question, its a really great question. Im grateful of you asking that question. Honestly I just like the question.”
The fact that this was his answer to “what specific mistakes did you make” is utterly ridiculous
*Gets explicitly asked to answer with a yes or no*

Vlad's answers: "THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION, THANK YOU FOR ASKING"

*continues to tell a story about everything except the subject*
I laughed so fucking loud when he answered.. I scared my dog!
I really wish they had continued that line of questioning. It's clear he had no answer and was going to implicate himself
when the apps stopped buys and only allow sales, who were they selling to? I never saw or heard that answer.
If i was taking a test, and after the question it said to give a yes or no answer, and i wrote an answer on the side instead; that answer would be wrong and be held against my final grade. 

Same should apply.
Vlad is simp incarnate
“So you had liquidity issues but you closed buy side for meme stocks, while leaving sell side completely unaffected and your first interview explaining your behavior stated that liquidity was not a problem twice and you tapped credit lines proactively to ensure liquidity wouldn’t be a problem in the future?”

“Basically I was writing checks faster than daddy allowed allegedly.”

“Did you have a liquidity problem?”

“Yes, no, maybe.”

“Schrödinger's liquidity?”

“The irony sir is not lost to me that the kitty is indeed **roaring** right meow.”

He really seems to just be the fall guy here
Can anyone send me the clip of this when it comes out. His face was priceless!!!
Guy is going to prison and he learned today hes the actual bag holder lmao the irony.
OK, I'm calling it right here right now... If they're still short and it all blows up and goes to the moon. Melvin (not actually named Melvin btw, just learned that one last night) is going to epstein himself and leave a note taking all the blame to absolve citadel dude
I literally DIED when he got choked up
It’s a psychological game Vlad plays to appease the questioners into thinking “yea, I made him feel bad...my job is done, no further action needed”
Basically thank you for the question. It's the nicest anyone has been lately.
Anybody else worried Vlad is gonna tell his limo driver to stop so he can get out and pummel a homeless man to death
How many people in the room with you? Five. Lmfao.
Honestly he’s the low one on the totem pole, vlad has been thrown to the wolves
Yes or no
Do you think he just realized at that moment that he was the fall guy?
I'm guessing he won't be CEO for much longer.
Rep: "Can you testify...."

Vlad: "Thank you for the question - but fuck you. Nothing is going to come from this so I don't actually have to answer anything."

This is fucking bullshit. They can lie or just straight up not answer. What's the point of this theatre.
Vlad got poned same with the hedgies. They couldn't give a straight answer all day!
Can we get more Vlad memes and comments going?
Id just like to remind everyone that this is not political theatre,  thank you for your truly awe inspiring questions
This was the fucking best part. 

“So what mistakes were made exactly?” 

“I admit to......improving”


The guy went WHITER than he already was. 

So many Fs they gonna call him Flad
I hope the tendie police get this motherfucker
Q: But what will you improve?

‘Ummmm, gulp’
that gulp spoke volumes
"What a good looking question. Well, I was born in Bulgaria'
Surprised he didn’t start spouting syntax error or straight up 404 in front of us. 

On a side note this was probably the most frustrating thing to watch because they all start with lobs and just when the committee member take their actual shot. Time was up. That or they would go for broke immediately until the member decides to ask someone else a question that they would be willing to answer. DFV answers like one who did the homework and had nothing to hide.
citadels bag holder
He trapped himself the day he controlled our trading, he’s just having to admit to it now!
“What’s the rate? We both know $35bn is just a number without a rate”
What the fuck is "admitting to improving"

Committing?  Is that it?  And if it is it, what kind of meaningless evocative drivel...
Anyone else think it was funny when there was technical difficulties & Maxine was holding up her finger over & over.

They showed Vlad & he did a holy shit I’m freaked out side eye look to the other pple in the room with him. I couldn’t stop laughing.

Then Plotkin said their shorts were exploited trying to draw any type of sympathy. Just unbelievable the shenanigans today.
classic interview technique. I admit to having a strength as my biggest flaw!
If you can’t stop the small guy from building their houses on your yard stop selling the tools necessary to build the house, technically we’re free to invest but taking out tool seems like a plan to achieve the same goal, if they create regulations against robinhood those will be applied for other platforms
Clearly does that, and skirts around the questions, to eat up time.
So inspiring!
Thank you for your question. I’m glad you asked this very important question. I will now proceed to not answer it even when you repeatedly ask me to answer it.
This line was truly horrible
I love when someone asked what mistakes exactly did he made and he was telling what they did to improve instead.. i mean what a fucking shitshow
What zero pussy does to a mfer
I went ape shit (pun intended) when he said that and realized he screwed up while smiling
Clown shit
“Vlad the thief”
A collective “huh” was echoed across the galaxy
He does a lot of gulping audibly for someone with nothing to hide...
Thank you for your question, I appreciate it so very much. What a great question. I look forward to answering your question (which I appreciate) and beginning a conversation on this as I find it very important. My god, what a great question. Thank you for asking such a beautiful question. We here at robinhood are not perfect and have made mistakes in the past, not only that, but we are fucking retarded.
Was watching a video of testimony on YouTube. Got interrupted by an add for E*TRADE with the tag line don’t get mad, get E*TRADE. Brilliant ad positioning.
Easily one of the top moments of the day.
Guh
yes or no
He is such a fraud Vlad the fraud
"What can you do to make sure we don't have to have anymore of these hearings Mr. Tenev?"

Tenev: "Well this was pretty surprising to us but next time we'll hide our bullshit better."
every fucking question
The ole pardon my take secret:

“That is a fantastic question...”
“Thank your for the question...”
“Great question...”
I can't believe I trusted this asshole with my money at one point in time.  Well, he fooled me once, but he won't fool me twice.
Let’s coin a new term called getting Vlad, it means art of dodging the question and parroting the scripted answers.
That was like being asked in an interview, “what are some of your weaknesses,” and replying with, “well I am always trying to improve and sometimes I try too hard to improve”
Was anyone else triggered by the shitty quality of the captions? Jesus.
Was Vlad one of the merrymen?
He would get Destroyed OP'n AMA.
It sounds like a quote from a casting couch.
You can see this quote here. It's embarrassing

[https://youtu.be/D7N4S\_FKMq4?t=18230](https://youtu.be/D7N4S_FKMq4?t=18230)
Did anyone make a highlight cut of this yet?
It appears Vlad got semi impaled today
What a total scumbag
lol, they got him good with that question.
When do we get an automod named Vlad that thanks us for our dumbass waste of time questions
Vlad the V Card Holder
Hahahahaha
This is the classic response they teach in political communication training for difficult questions. Thank you, then answer briefly and/or redirect to your key point.
The question was,

"You admitted that you made some mistakes. What mistakes did you specifically make, so that we can make sure it doesn't happen again?"

Unfortunately, I wasn't paying attention to who asked the question.
I am happy to say I completed transferring my funds to my bank account and sold all my shares on Robinhood and de-activated my Robinhood account. Sorry Vlad, after what you guys did restricting trades from certain companies shows Robinhood is the opposite of the free market. "Steal from the poor and give to the rich" should be your new slogan. No...your sad robot picture when I de-activated will not get me to go back to Robinhood
Nobody and I mean nobody can beat this guy when it comes to talking in circles
Did you see that fucking scumbag Gabe try to act like we are all anti-Semitic scum. Playing on the Democrats identity politics. No one gives a fuck if they are from Mars. Gabe Plotkin can give me a blumpkin.
this was answer to the question "you said you're learning from your mistakes. what mistakes did you make?"


it's just like during the job interview, when they ask "what's your biggest weakness?"
Man I wish you could call puts on IPOs.
**Yes or No Vlad.** 

That's a great question and I'm glad you asked it. I'm very thankful to be here today to answer your questions. Like I'd stated in my written testimony which I've presented to you and you are welcome to read..

*..Now, this is a story all about how*  
*My life got flipped-turned upside down*  
*And I liked to take a minute*  
*Just sit right there*  
*I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air..*
Fuck Robinhood!
He’s a fucking weasel. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)
This is just a hunch.

Do people feel like Robinhood is going to be scapegoated in this process, thereby locking out one of the most popular retail investor apps in the process? At the end of the day, I can’t help but feel that it’s always going to be stacked against us. We’re angry at Robinhood, but in praying for their demise we shoot ourselves in the foot unless we can come up with something better for ourselves
Ken "hastily stares left-right" Griffin and Vlad "thank you for the question" Tenev. What a bunch of fucking tools these cheaters are
hmm that's not the actual quote tho, is it?

somebody get it right, please
I am not a cat
I feel like it's just a tactic to waste a bit of time every question.
Thank you for asking that question, it was a very important question
YES or NO
"uh thank you congressperson uh please let me keep my billions and uh let me keep making money out of poor people and uh we are called robin hood because we want to help the the poor but uh we made mistakes but I admit to try to improve always and uh thank you very important question maybe we should change some rules we can talk about that later but uh so far we helped people not make 35 billion because that includes unrealised gains and we spam people to buy more stocks but uh we try to educate them but they are retards and keep buying and uh gme is a black swan easter egg who helped us get a cushy $3.4 billion from our hedgie buddies by blackmailing them using our customer frustration and self-declaring the risk to be too high so uh we blocked buy but not sell because blocking sell would be bad for uh" "time's up next speaker please"
Reading tons of comments in threads here on WSB and other stock subs, people OUTRAGED that the witnesses "aren't answering questions!" and "the republicans are just wasting time and asking softballs" like, dude, welcome to every congressional testimony ever.  Ya'll should see some with Jim Jordan.
That is one of the most important questions that we have had here today. When my family came to America I learned so much about the American dream and what it means to people. I believe in the democratization of the financial system and the benifit that it provides to your average American. Robinhood users have gained more than 35B in the united states equity markets. These retail investors would under no circumstances have put their money in the market without Robinhood. Robinhood accomplished this miraculous feat while also in no way gameifying investing. The vast majority of our clients buy and hold and absolutely none of them abuse margin or start trading options without first educating themselves. In fact 3 million people have educated themselves with our services that are definitely not just for marketing and growing our user base. We care about our users and provide them the absolute best completely automated support experience that could be fit in our budget. We are incredibly responsible and carefully consider all of our actions . That is why our platform has never experienced major bugs or glitches and why we have never had major service outages. Quite frankly, it is the regulators who were irresponsible by insisting we prepare for the unexpected. So to sum up a short answer to your question. We here at Robinhood were only following the law. If we were completely unregulated then this horrible situation would never have happened. Our history of treating our customers well and providing exceptional products shows that regulatons are definitely unnecessary. So, to be frank, yes my name is Vlad Tenev.
“I appreciate the question”
That is an excellent question a VERY good question.
“What an excellent question”
I took far too many gulps of wine because of that line... gotta change my drinking game rules for the next hearing
I'm feeling thank you
I wish I could reclaim MY time
I thought I was getting a nose bleed after hearing “thank you for the question” for the thousandth time, in as slow a manner as possible just to burn time. What a joke
Why are American tech founders so alien like? Facebook, Reddit, Amazon, Robinhood, Tesla? What’s going on?
"Yes or No, sir!"
Spot on.
That was good, and then he admitted to making a mistake too. Poor bastard, hopefully he gets the shaft
Freudian slip for sure
Heck these days you can be a president too.
All you need in America is a college degree and charm and you can make 6 figures. Got a sibling who is full blown retarded but went to college and kisses ass like trumps his boss
Mr. retard_wknd do these allegations against you hold any truth? Feel free to avoid actually answering the question, but thank us many times for our time.
Vlad is a former HFT dev. Don't be fooled.
Who supports an IPO with this man at the helm?
You can be a CEO tomorrow if you start your own company.
You likely live in the USA. Some claim the greatest country on Earth. I disagree. I think USA as a country is scum and frankly if I lived there, I would put a revolver in my mouth and pull the trigger. But back to the lecture at hand, you wanting to be CEO - The entire system in the USA is built on logic that people like you can never be CEO, or president. You're dumb as a mule and twice as ugly. If a strange man offers you a ride, I say take it!
So you’re saying your strengths are your weakness
I care too much.  I sing in the shower. Sometimes I run over women with my car.
Tell me your strengths without telling me your strengths
Nobody questioned him about why he went on TV the night before and claimed he was blocking the buying of stock to protect the customers.
Did he commit perjury by claiming the 3B they brought in was to secure future trading and not because of a current cash-crisis?  
Yes.
He also said they had a phone number.. (Not a functioning one worth a shit) What's your call bank budget compared to your peers? Umm 
$41.
"aaaaand, we're out of time. Next question please."
What kind of moron answers that question though? Answers to those questions might actually result in something happening to you.

"YES or NO—dodge is no"
OK vlad, I want an honest answer.... What mistakes were made? .  Vlad: points at himself. Congress: OK now we're getting somewhere
He did say something like, “to avoid mistakes in the future”. Then he gulped some more and basked in the beauty of the question
people using Etrade, tda, tasty, ibkr, webull, vanguard, fidelity, fasttrade, charles schwab... (list goes on of  almost every brokerage not called robinhood)

Sadly no one is going to prison. All these fuckers will return to their "palaces" and continue living the good life.

The system is inherently stacked against the common man and we are all so divided along stupid issues that most don't seem to realize who is actually fucking them in the ass (and not in a good way).
Blumpkin?
Gabe Plotkin filed for divorce this month. Hes just storing his $$ in his soon to be ex but I doubt they are actually fighting.
I missed it, which minute did it happen
Dude has such a limited vocabulary, and I don’t think “psychological games” are in his dictionary
I get more of a rapey type vibe from Vlad more than a violent one. I bet he is snap chatting his dealer for some roofies right now.
Vlad would never use his energy on just one person. No if he want’s to take out his anger it will be on masses, I’m sure right now he is doubling down on his human trafficking business back in Bulgaria.

It was actually " I admit to Always improving." I also fucked up and spelt "appreciate" wrong... It was in responses to catching him on saying how they did everything right then being asked then "what were the mistakes he was apologizing for." 

I was honestly just laughing so hard as I pulled up paint to make this that I admittingly fucked it up a little.
None of the other involved parties would confirm that they were not cats.

Can you rephrase the question...
Let me rephrase the question... feline... think deeply.
Along with throwing "thoughts and prayers" rambles in there. Has nobody told them we use that phrase to make fun of their ineffectual signaling now?
It allows 5 extra seconds to access the most appropriate  brain folder of bullshit.
Thank you for the question, and it’s a great question. Before I answer it let me first say...
Noooo way you think?
Thank you sir. I want to go ahead and take the opportunity to acknowledge the question you've just asked me, and If you don't mind me saying so, It was a very good question, and I understand why you'd ask such a question, so thank you again!.

who was the rep who called out the *literal confetti* and lootbox stock and referral stock and other things robinhood does?

To be clear, I don't actually have a problem with those things, but I would like RH to be honest about their approach.
dont forget "I would love to help you figure out any regulations"
>Ya'll should see some with Jim Jordan.



Man the past 3 weeks have been pretty shitty as it is, why do you have to go and remind us of that giant piece of garbage.
Let’s get real here, both republicans and democrats alike hate what happened with GME. This is entirely nonpolitical. This first meeting is just pomp and circumstance to appease the masses. The actual meaningful discussions will only occur when DTCC is available to rationalize their continued existence in a world where instantaneous closing occurs.

Both sides made it pretty clear with their lines of questioning that T+2 is something that is worth investigating.
It’s bullshit every time, you’re giving people shit for having a reaction to the bullshit?

because empathy is a liability in business.

and without empathy, people are not really human.
Have you not seen any of the German CEOs? They were built by Boston Dynamics
Nerds.
Probably the autism.
Lawyers

Edit; at least when they are in front of a camera, lawyers in their room/ear/brain make them come off as alien
I think Elon musk, while still being socially awkward, is an exception to the otherwise robot-like CEOs.
Most tech founders tend to be those kids who have struggled with developing social skills. They are great at programming and designing algorithms but having those interpersonal skills is just as important. Technology allows one side to thrive without needing the other side
Many of those CEOs built their businesses literally. They are programmers/engineers with huge drive and as someone who works in software development the personality type is familiar to me. Personally I prefer Vlad/Zuck over those hedge fund CEOs. At least they look uncomfortable lying to us...
Because they have to be very careful with what they say. Anything they say can be used in court against them, and they (and their legal teams) know that so they get coached on how to avoid questions while seeming honest, which is a very hard task for someone who is not a trained politician or lawyer.

Take the citadel guy for example. When asked whether pay for order flow gives as good an execution as a direct order, he simply can't answer. If he says the truth (no it doesn't) he's admitting to violating the law, because the sec rule specifically says they have a duty of providing the best possible execution. If he says they do, he's blatantly lying, which can be used against him in the future. So he just dodges the question as best as he can.

C'mon, the only mistake Robinhood made was always improving, did you miss that?
You can be a president if you are a potato. But you must be a very rich potato to begin with.
Am I your sibling??
Go heavy enough on the charm and you don't even need the paper.
Lack of empathy is a bonus
That's where I went wrong I'm autistic as fuck with no charm.

I'm forgainst it!
He *did* block the buying of stock to protect the customers. The customer being Citadel, of course. 

Robinhood users aren't customers, they're a product being sold.
wasn't only 1B required for the current crisis, according to his testimony, and the rest was to shore up for future.
The gentleman's time has expired.
This is why we feel learned helplessness in relation to “politics” and having any change on big businesses. And you’re right, this is the system currently set up, lieing and filibusters are not only allowed but effectively highly encouraged.
It really sucks that more members of congress didn't just say things like "well since my cohort ran out of time I'd like to ask the same thing and let him finish. What mistakes *did* you make?" Stalling for 5 minutes is easy, stalling for 5 hours is much much harder.

How about you guys actually make these fucking pieces of shit liable for once? Fear can be an effective motivator too. Come the fuck on, you guys keep blathering on about "leader of the free world" and "take my freedoms from my dead hands" and you're just gonna let  Professor Snape Junior run away with your tendies and laugh? The whole fucking world is watching, you know. I would be planning AT THE VERY LEAST to participate in some major protests if I were in NYC. I'm being annoying to the point of inconvenience to everyone I know who is minimally interested in stocks to make SURE they understand the level of fuckery and not-technically-but-actually fraud going on with this GME bullshit.

You're just going to let these fuckers get away, just like that?
"Sadly no one is going to prison." - Vlads going to prison. Hes the fall guy for all of this. Hes going to lay on the sword all the lies will come out he will admit he did it thinking hes going to club fed and he wont hes going to share a prison cell with a guy who believed he was god so he murdered 16 people in 2 days.

Is that guy actually Bulgarian? I know he has Bulgarian sounding name but my god, we are really sorry for this piece of shit and we would take him back anytime to re-educate him.
Fucking tell me about it. A class act all around
Not dumb, just evil and got caught massively overplaying a ridiculously bad hand. They know it. They know if they got margin called for all the shorts at the same time, the consequences would've been... shit, no one really knows, but it would probably make 1929 look like a fucking joke. They need to stall for time so they can commit more fraud to hide the fraud they already commited
Yeah,  he's not not against regulation but nobody in this hearing is going to ask any kind of strong follow up questions so... what a fuckin joke,  honestly.
All in all today I saw one cat and a bunch of pussies

Then who?
The DTCC does a lot of back office stuff and error correcting. That is what the T+2 time frame is for. 

They also guarantee all trades in the market and allow each of us to trade freely without concern for counter party risk. They get a few thousandths of a penny for each share that they clear in order to take on that burden.

I think that’s a requirement. Empathy apparently is a weakness in corporate America.
Good one. I'm pasting that in response to as many comments as I can for the next 10 min!
The gentleman's time has expired.
That Senator was spot on when she referred to us as product. It's fucking pathetic
Generally speaking if you get a service for free you are the product. This applies to Google, reddit anything really. It's also surprisingly why apple actually doesnt sell customer data they just charge you for their services.
True, the users are the product.
I believe the real answer, baaed on info I saw posted somewhere around here, is that 3B was necessary until they chose to restrict trading of meme stocks, at which point the requirement was reduced by 2.2B. i believe the congressman from Guam tried to address this?
Best I can piece together the timeline it sounds like first RH received a $3B margin call, then they started working to raise the capital, but in the meantime stopped GME trading and were therefore able to negotiate the $3B down to $700M, but they'd already set in motion the $3B capital raise, so now they're calling it a cushion for the future.
Good bot
>  if I were in NYC.

given the level of this rant, you'd think there was some magical way someone could make it to NYC.
Apparently the wsb hitmen are on the case

Edit: key words; allegedly apparently
Shall we make a wager that the worst thing that happens to these guys (including Vlad) is maybe a small fine.
You are beautiful!
Sounds like he spent most of his formative time in the US. So, he is just an American being fashionably foreign, really.
He is, unfortunately...
I wish when I overplayed my bad hands the dealer just gave me back my all-in, and when the competitors said, “hey! No fair!” I called in the pit boss to deal with them

Somebody was definitely either flipping cue cards or working a teleprompter. Especially for Citadel.
Cant wait until he declares himself emperor of Mars as soon as they’re self sufficient and cut all communications with earth.

He’d have a handpicked fuckbunch of scientists and other geniuses so the gene pool would be immaculate.

Damn he could even fake and issue and personally break the comms not telling the colonists and just be the defacto ruler

I just made this up retardedly but I’d totally watch that show.
Instructions unclear, dick stuck in potato
Finally I found my weakness
Is this just a meme or do you guys actually think this?

Long game.
that makes perfect sense. thanks.
You know, you just might have a point here. My rage has reached levels I just might buy a plane ticket to NYC just to have fun with other retards in wall street with other retards, depending on how this plays out

Edited my post in order to not let hedge funds use it at the next hearing.
Don't let my dreams be dreams my dude

Make it our dreams

PS this is not violence advice, congressmen/women
Easy enough when you ARE the casino and you just bet the fucking casino that you could steal a homeless man's blanket with a bluff on a 72 offsuit and he's holding pocket aces and made a set on the flop. You thought he'd never call that bluff, it's his blanket, his last posession, he would never risk it, right?

&#x200B;

Obviously when the casino loses the bet they'll weasel out of paying. However, if that homeless man informs his homeless friends of what happened and they set the fucking casino on fire... casino owners in the future may be careful of pulling this shit.
Hey, it sounds like you're struggling. Reddit has some great resources for any problem, but unless that problem is having too much money, WSB is not the right sub for you right now. Take a break for a bit. We'll be here when you're ready.

I think he means the other guys are like... the mice or something.
Yeah you could see him constantly looking above the camera, his eyes scanning left to right, and talking at the average speed of someone typing. Even admitted to 4 other people being in the room with him.

Robinhood’s CEO was pretty obviously reading as well. He was constantly ending statements with upwards inflections, then he’d just sit there with a blank face. Like he didn’t realize that was the end of the answer and he’s still waiting for more words to appear.
I actually think this. And I have 12+ years experience in the corporate world as support. 

I care about my staff having work/life balance and actually liking their job. The jackass who puts unreasonable deadlines and works his team to death gets the promotion instead. It’s happened enough that I’ve just accepted it is a weakness.

It’s awesome watching these millionaire representatives trying to speak for retail investors. This woman just said the restrictions had no momentum on the rise of gme share price...
Horrible editing. 10/10 I like it

Wait, is this real?? Or is this a deep fake?
Lol
Maxine is one ugly bitch.
Wtf is up with the fake ass Reddit reactions !!
AOC so hot. She can interrogate me anytime.
The irony in a lot of this is that people were making DFV (Keith Gill) out as some average guy who figured out the GME edge... as opposed to being the chartered financial analyst and certified financial planner that he is. That is, he is a player in the system that this all ended up targeting. Meanwhile a lot of diamond hands have tight grips on the bags that they've been left holding.
Lmaoo

I didn't right away, but when he said I like this stock I was on the floor.
This is exactly why the market was red today!! Everyone was too busy watching DEEP FUCKING VALUE! It was a joke btw, most of the congressmen/women, were pretty clueless.
I think the original excitement is from when England beat Sweden in the quarterfinals in 2018. I hope I am wrong because that shit still hurts.
i love how shitty quality this video is
He likes the stock
what hearing?
I though this was legit for a sec.....
this is awesome, but man that must have been a quick and dirty edit.
I am out of the loop as to what's going on. Would someone mind filling me in?
Shoddy editing.

Cut off when they didn't get an answer they wanted
It would have been a lot more epic if he got to actually go to the capitol irl. Then we’d get the iconic shot of him sitting in the chamber before Congress.
O/
Mr Griffin, did you receive any advice from citadel about gme????  Sorry, out of time... next question.  Bs...
I LIKE THE STOCK, CHEERS!
Still got the gaming chair lol... so weird to see him in a suit.

haha.. this is awesome!!! DFV to the moon
I am not a cat!
He is not a cat.
that timing was garbage bro
Imagine having stoop so low to address questions from crazy ass Maxine Waters.
K is that dfv or roaring kitten or something so confused lol
May be able to play the stock market but can't avoid a large social gathering like this during a global pandemic. Think you guys are taking this "retard" thing a little too seriously.
Possibly a dumb question: from what I’ve seen, GME has dropped pretty far. Are people not selling because they feel it’ll rebound or out of wanting to show hedge funds that they can be beat at their own game?
How the fuck does time expire when she has to wait on you dumbfucks to turn off your mics for half the time!!!
By far the best thing about this is how poorly it was edited.  Pure pure gold.
that "hang in there" sign and the red headband. lol
HODL TRACKING!
That Max woman has a face for radio
This made my day! We speak your name Deep Fucking Value!!!!
Can we rent out an AMC and watch live
Lol
Listen.... after watching all his videos, I bought a magic 8 ball for financial advice.
Imagine being at a bar and meeting someone and saying your name is deepfuckingvalue and they know who you are and go ballistic. This guy is a legend. Free drinks for life.
Anybody have a link to the actual hearing?
Absolute fucking legend
So true lol
Except for the part where GME is 45.
What's on the screen behind DFV?
At first I thought that video was really on the screen I was like how are all these people watching that and why tf am I not there
I am not a cat.
That man is a fucking legend. Even the bartenders are jumping
I'm out of the loop. Who is he and why so popular??
This should be him saying "I like the stock"
He likes the stock!!!
Ape Noises
These pre virus videos look so strange...
You already know fam , eating crayons the whole time. We like the stock !
Would be great if he brought his 8 ball and explains how he uses it to pick stocks

D: “When I’m second guessing a stock, I just grab my 8 ball and give it a shake”

8: “No”

D: “Sometimes I shake it multiple times”

8: “Not today”

D: “I shake it if I don’t like the wording”

8: “Don’t buy the stock”

D: “Yeah that’s not a good one”

8: “Retard”

D: “Well that’s not entirely inaccurate but not what I’m looking for”

8: “GME is retail and it’s being hammered by corona & digital companies”

D: “That ones too long to read”

8: “Fine, buy the stock. Retard”

D: “Yeah I like the stock too”

There’s an actual video of him doing something like this on his YouTube channel. The 8 ball said no like 6 times in a row.
He's so well spoken! love me some DFV
The entire world love him
That woman interviewing him asked the banks why they keep giving out student loans. They all replied the government took that over. She had no clue and gave them that Pelosi clapping hands.

These government employees got too much power.
great edit job
Brobeans, i just like the stock wtf
Let’s go

 I just found out by accident if you listen to Mozarts Requiem in D minor, K.626: 3. Sequentia: Confutatis.. Directly followed with Lacrimosa (composed by John Eliot Gardiner) it becomes a much more EPIC and BEAUTIFUL moment. I feel I must share this with you all. (low volume of course)
No. This is what happened when he said that.

His 5 mins were enough to boost GME by $4, so imagine 20
The more he talks more they have a chance to intimate him... This hearing is not to defend the small investor
Just wait until he starts releasing videos again. We will get there, patience!  People like his analysis.
He dressed exactly like robinhood ceo lmao
Idk why but that hit me in the fee fees too
Yeah I'm going to purchase the poster from my local GameStop when they come in. Not sure if you've heard of the store before, they are a leader in their industry, and have a wonderful rewards program.
Exactly my thought. Most of them are as guilty as the parties involved in this bs.
it didn't hit me in the feels, i just bought a few more shares of gamestop when i saw it

What is that a reference to?
Seriously. Him and Rep from Guam are on my have lunch with bucket list
Did you hear those references to diamond hands, coming back to earth, and such? Boom
Still made me lol
It's ok the vfx were so top notch we forgive you
I just want to know how you made this, because I want to use that video (and audio) as a template for my own stuff.

CNBC said it was a detailed coordinated effort to bankrupt Melvin Capital like it was a coup against the big guy, and not the fact that it was one of the most heavily shorted stocks out there at a ultra low price making it the perfect intersection of the Venn diagram. Fuck CNBC and their sticking up for the big players. CNBC is the FOX NEWS of investing.
Deepfuckingvalue is now a millionaire speaking for retail investors.

##LONG STORY SHORT, HE LIKES THE STOCK
I dont think you mean that. DFV doesnt influence your trading decisions. You are making these decisions by yourself. His videos were not trading advice and he advises everyone to not follow him.
I was so happy during this time. Plz bring back the good times!
But he sold a lot of his calls?
#IF HES NOT SELLING IM NOT SELLING
I enjoyed watching this go on for awhile but got disheartened when things tanked for you guys. Did he really not sell?

He doesn’t need to talk to be intimate with my wife
Yea I'm guessing legal counsel advised him to stay away from social media until this is all passed.
Kinda like Dr. Phill vs Dr. Phill
You got a fifi, too?
I've had a pro account with them for so long and I keep forgetting to cancel it, but I think at this point I'll just let it roll lol.
Samesies. I purchased 11 more shares, which isn't a whole lot but it made sense for me. Not so much because DFV was goaded into saying "yes I would buy more shares", but because he overtly stated several times throughout the session that he still believes in the company and RC. I really do think it's a good long play.
The poster is an old motivational picture that's sort of developed a meme status over 5 decades, but it seems poignant here as DFV more than likely knows many of us are watching his deposition. I'd like to think it's a nod to his love of the stock and the long play mentality he has.

The red bandana or headband is a staple of Keith Gill's outfit, and while the majority of WSB would have sucked each of our collective wives' boyfriends' dicks to see him wear it, he likely kept to the dress code for appearances sake.

But he still hung it up so the people could see that despite his change in attire, he's still the same guy.
Dude I started making a list after the GA reps jumped off a cliff. The senator from Guam really impressed me so I added him to the “has shit together” list.
It was Guam!? I was wondering where that guy was from. He was a beast but needs to change his battery in his fire alarm
lets just blame reddit and not OP for fucking it up. 

Fucking reddit! Every time!
The quality was complete garbage. I LOVE IT!
Literally any video editor will let you superimpose images, and with much better results than this (unless you're lazy). Personally I use Adobe Premiere.

Agreed. It’s fine for Melvin to drive gme and other companies into bankruptcy, putting thousands out of work, but as soon as the tables are turned they decide we shouldn’t get a fair shot. It’s disgusting and infuriating, especially knowing that they aren’t going to be properly penalized
no, CNBC is the FOX NEWS of fake news.
He was one of us though, I’m glad to have HIM represent us

Source vid?
Short story, long.
Long naked short, he likes the stock.
#WE HAD FUN
Don’t give them a reason
NO, HE LIKES the STONK !

He said STONK.
The STONK.
If I didn't know any better today... it sounded like he kept saying stonk rather than stock.
I just like the stock
I can't understand anything he says unless it's in red crayon.
But, I thought he was a cat in a headband...
Does anyone know if DFV did an in depth analysis of GMEs financials? Perhaps on one of his livestreams?
He made money selling some deep in the money call options most of which have long since expired, he has not sold any of his 50,000 shares as of his last update
He's long GME and been making videos about why for over a year but can anyone honestly tell me they wouldn't have sold at least some of the shares when it skyrocketed!? He's living in a rental ffs if he sold enough at the top to fully purchase a house for his family, have money for kids to go to college etc... that sounds like a perfectly reasonable decision to me
He sold $13M in options, but didn't sell his shares.  He could've made up to $40M+ if he sold everything, so the "If he's not selling, I'm not selling!" is mainly redditors meme-ing that they aren't truly bag-holders by copying DFV in not selling shares.
Fuck DFV is a brilliant person. Damn he deserves every penny.
Thank you fellow ape.

I'd say he still is one of us and is just obscenely wealthy now. But when he owns Gamestop entirely I think it might be a lil different.

God, I love you traders!
Correct.
More than likely, I could see it
Yeah that too for sure...which is sad because it's really not his fault at all
He just means less risky investments that pay relatively consistent interest over time. Could also explore high interest saving accounts for liquidity, GICs etc. If he invested just $1MM of his $13MM at 6% annual interest that's  $60M/year interest. I don't know about you, but with that kinda dough I would never work for anyone other than myself again, if at all.

Thanks!! I’m a super noob at this stuff, so appreciate your patience! Btw 2 questions:

1. When you say $60M/year interest, you mean 60 million a year? If DFV made 13 mil, and invested 1 mil, how does he make 60 mil? Unless I totally misunderstood you

2. As far as i can see, ETFs don’t pay you interest right? High yield savings accounts right now seem to be giving you just 1% APY. Is there some other option to invest money for high tied interest?

TITLE: Summary of the hearing if you've been missing outTEXT: Did Vlad change his wig at recess?
Best two lines to come out of this hearing were both by DFV #1 “I’m not a cat” and #2 “I just like the stock” all while his red headband is hanging from a poster of a cat with the phrase “hang in there” u/deepfuckingvalue is a god damn legend!
Vlad isn't being roasted he is straight up being cooked up in magma.
You're a Rocket Engineer. Come on you can do better.
Rep. San Nicholas of Guam really beat the shit out of Vlad: [https://youtu.be/i8hJ9LwGvqU](https://youtu.be/i8hJ9LwGvqU)
Some of the congress members are playing nice with Vlad and giving him softballs
Thank You Congressman Philmacrack, I appreciate the question and your insightful meme.
Don't forget Plotkin on the sidelines claiming he was called bad names.
I love how this accurately depicts how Vlad is dodging every single question.
Congress is verbally DEFILING Vlad and I love it
More like Melvin smoking the pipe.

Vlad gets all the shit while RH are just puppets here.
He is not a cat
Idk who else caught it but Vlad wasnt brown nosing with the "Thank you for the important question", notice how slow he talked. He was trying to stall the questions knowing that it was timed.
Best part of having covid and being on quarantine today was getting to see Vlad get rag-dolled all afternoon
this is accurate in the sense that it distracts from and obfuscates the real issue which is DTCC's role in this.
For those confused, today was the hearing for the whole gamestop debacle. 

Vlad (Robinhoodlum), griffin/other hedge funds, and DFV (if you don't know who he is, just leave) were all asked questions and etc. 
Vlad and HFs basically got their asses handed to them by the congressmen while DFV was the only one actually answering yes or no because he has nothing to hide and just likes the stock. 

Here is an example of an answer from Vlad when asked about liquidity issues:

That is a good question and I acknowledge that it is a good question. Before I answer than here is some extra BS.

Here's an answer from DFV when asked if he would buy the stock at $45: 

Yes.
I wouldn’t say people missed much, talking in circles and none of the important questions were answered. A lot of the important questions were not even asked, and some of the committee seemed extremely out of touch.
This guy is having the time of his life
Vlad is a red herring. The DTCC needs to be investigated. They really shouldn’t waste their energy on that ant. Go after the elephant shitting all over the room.
The guam guy was awesome
Thank you for that, congressman/congresswoman
These fucking HF boys are all getting let off easy.  No repercussions of this, just continue to abuse the system and fuck the retailers.  The rich and powerful using their government pawns like usual.
Where can I see it online???
I love this pic. The dude is so hyped that the chicks are fighting he needs to smokeabowl to enjoy it more
When will you autists realize that Vlad was just another pawn in this game, like us. The real enemy is Citadel, who has a history of pre-filling their orders over retailers so they can get ahead of any pop or drop in price. They've been fined multiple times for it but they still do it because it's a small price to pay to make billions.
any idea where i'll be able to watch the full vid when its all over?

&#x200B;

also petition to turn febuary 18th into a holiday.
not really they didnt address a lot of the important questions. i hope they do, but sadly i dont think things will change
Seems legit, looks like the girl missed on her follow through
So I'm new here and really confused. What's going on?
Ya im surprised they didnt grill melvin more

Accurate.
This is the best thing I have seen in 31 years.
Accurate.
Citadel got destroyed too
Damn I love this community
[removed]
Weed stonkz finna moon now?
Spot on.
Vlad looked like someone had taken a giant dump in his cheerios this morning
There's one takeaway: we heard from gill and spez the least.

Why? They were the only ones telling the truth.
Link to og pic?
Congress did nothing but pitch softballs to Vlad, and all he did was bunt them because they had no intention of pursuing those softballs.  


His lawyers just typed answers for him on a teleprompter after he spent 15 seconds saying "Thank you, uh, senator, I really appreciate you asking this very important question... ...but I think we should discuss it in a different format."
Imagine congress pretending they give a shit. The only part of the show that isn't scripted, is the input from u/DeepFuckingValue
That’s what I was doing when I was watching it.
"A few things I am not. I am not a cat...."
I get how you all are focused on our players in the game but WTF on the Congress people.  We have some smart ones but damn there are some dumb fucks in Congress.
classic   fuck yeah
 Let me start by saying I am not a cat from Bulgaria...
Thanks. I've been looking for a summery.

Pretty boss move casually leaving the “hang in there” kitten poster in the background. DFV is a legend.
Ahh, a man of culture. 

Havn't seen this meme format in a while..
Dude this is so accurate
I always laugh at this image because guy in the right reminds me of a friend
Someone make a compilation video so I don’t have to sift through all the other fucking dweebs
I was looking forward to today's hearing until I realized Rep. Katie Porter has not been allowed to continue with her seat on the Finance committee.

[https://thehill.com/policy/finance/534335-porter-loses-seat-on-house-panel-overseeing-financial-sector](https://thehill.com/policy/finance/534335-porter-loses-seat-on-house-panel-overseeing-financial-sector)

This is only the first hearing, so let's make sure Rep. Porter is back for the next one and we can have real accountability and transparency into the financial systems so we can ALL benefit.

Democratization requires equality of opportunity for all. Right now Robin Hood has been stealing from you for the benefit of -1 HedgeFund. They're literally stealing from the poor to benefit the ultra-rich, and you helped them. You did so unwittingly and you were used, so make sure you get answers.

The real manipulation here is the fact you (the retail user) are trading on T1,2,3 settlements while your positions are being sold as order flows to HFs who ARE trading on real-time and when your order comes in 1,2,3 days later they've already made money on your call. You are getting ROBED by Rober HOod!

If you want Congress to get to the bottom of this, bring Katie Porter back.

You're the Reddit army! you can do it! Call Pelosi, Call Maxime, Call Call CAll.

These people are US congress representatives and if you're an American Citizen they represent you.

You pay their salary, you can ask them to do their job. Don't fall asleep at the wheel Reddit.

You have power, USE IT!
More respect to Vlad after this hearing, it is so easy to believe conspiracy theories, truth is it is the Democrats that wrote these regulations for brokers and clearing houses and now they are hammering Vlad for following those regulations?  LMAO retards really

For all the words that come out of Vlad's mouth, the only times I've ever heard him actually say anything were "we don't have a liquidity issue" and... I don't know, that might be it actually.
>if you don't know who he is, just leave

lol
I wished they grilled Griffin and Plotk a bit more. Vlads a scapegoat and also JUST ANSWER YES OR NO. 

And someone please blindfold Griffin so he can answer honestly instead of reading the teleprompter.
they got RH for fucking with the market but they barely touched the shorts fucking with the float. Robinhood never would have had a problem if the short interest hadn’t left earth
They’re congressderps. >50% of them are out of touch 80% of the time, every time.
Watching it now. The intro by Patrick McHenry is pretty on point.
"I don't understand anything about how the markets work but you are all bad evil men yes or no?"
It's on YouTube, just search GameStop Congress hearing live

If it makes you feel better, you can say citadel is behind the camera, meme still works
Their fines are just corruption taxes
YouTube - C-SPAN, Washington Post, CNBC and others have it posted
Just rich people dodging feigned questions from the people they own, who by sheer coincidence are Congresstoads.
Why would they grill their boss?
You mentioned something that looks like crypto. We get it, crypto is neat, but it's not our thing. [(Rule 4)](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules)

Damn. They make interns do shit like this nowadays. Ouch.
Wrong sub, loser.

I didn’t read a word of that
Bro what, I can't even read
Our lord savior DFV
Where’s the lie?
Must have been really pixelated
YES OR NO
It's actually pretty crazy to find someone you know I'm this sub nowadays. Cool
Thank You!
haha yea, the corpo responses were so formulaic and premeditated it was painful to listen to. Gotta say major props to the reddit CEO tho, he did a great job defending from any shade on the reddit crowd and the sub in particular.
Yeah I don’t even blame the reps that got angry and ended up diminishing their arguments, I would not be able to keep my cool talking to some of these slimy fucks
We didn’t know anything about DFV until his interview with the wsj came out. In the article, we get our first picture of this absolute legend in what looks like a basement wearing a red bandanna with multiple monitors in the background. He definitely fits the description of a badass everyday investor

or the whole hearing:

Look at the background of gill at the meeting to see the cat and red bandana. In his testimony he stated those statements
WTH have you been? Or did you just join an hour ago?
Wait so no more meme videos on the sub? I'll fuckin unsubscribe
God damnit, I had a gladiator opening fight video almost ready to go.
Thank God the fucking lord of the rings gme shit was so annoying
We need a greatest hits list so I can just rewatch the old ones.  There were countless gems and I have only been here a year.
Thank god lol
I'm too retarded to follow.
There was definitely a pattern.
Honestly I couldn't tell, one thing is clear both R and Ds do not have a grasp of the entire situation as much they claim to. Some dickbag was talking about taxing retail traders I think an R while another (D)ouchenozzle said something along the lines of prohibiting trades of stocks that get popular on social media and reddit communities (meme stocks) but there were also R and D that brought the fire to Vlad and the hedgies and wanted deregulation.

This entire thing really has opened my eyes to the fact that I bet there are R and Ds in here in equal amounts with no typical bickering, we all just want tendies and we want a redistribution of wealth from these greedy cockholes.

The one thing that DOES piss me off is the completely bogus claims that this sub or community members (as a whole) are anti semetic, or delusional conspiracy theorists or homophobes etc. And it does seem that that sentiment is coming from the left.

For the record I am a treehugging progressive who just likes the stock.
Obviously not the letter that organized the hearing.
YES OR NO
Haha yeah his answer was like when you are assigned a paper with a word limit  and you need to put fluff to get it there. All he was doing was killing time to stop them from asking more questions due to the time limit. He was probably hoping the next congress person wouldn't drill him as bad... and boi was he wrong.
Needs more "uhmmms".

Dogshit public speaker considering he's a ceo. We all know he's lying but shit dude give it a better shot.

Dfv is sat in his basement giving off straight ass'ed solid answers.
there was nothing to get. They asked plotkin about his shorts, he pointed out that they fulfill the locate requirement before shorting. There's really nothing else to do unless they want to call him a liar and make this a trial.
Who else could sit there all day and listen to this drivel?  
I'd love to run and change things, but you know you'd be facing day in and day out of "That's a good questions Congressperson, blah freaking blah blah"

FOR DAYZ
Thank you!!!
Exactly. I'd gladly pay 2 billion to make 10 billion
You think I'm an intern? ahahahahahaha
I didn't lose any money in the financial markets... I think you must be speaking to your own mirror reflection. There is no wrong sub for this message because EVERYONE in WSB should be all up the fact they took Katie out of the financial committee
Right, she actually has a brain.
You know she's a law professor right? I respect AOC but there is no comparison. ARe you seriously asking me how you copy and paste on reddit? I don't care about your flair, I just want to see a hearing where real questions are being asked.
"I appreciate the reaffirmation of the question. This expression towards Boolean rhetoric reminds me of a folksy anecdote back when I was growing up in Bulgaria to a poor family of 19 brothers and sisters, all of whom would be dismayed were I not to list their names in the following order..."
Let me start from the beginning, when I was a boy in Bulgaria...

Hang in there
> so formulaic and premeditated

dude was literally reading off a screen.

I don't exactly get how, since it came REALLY fast sometimes, but it was absolutely obvious. Even got called out by some rep asking how many people Griffin had in the room. 

They likely pre-wrote a lot of answers to any possible question and put them up for him to read. They have [lods of emone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULeDlxa3gyc) so even shit like having off-site lawyers, stenographers, etc tailoring the responses is completely reasonable to imagine. 

But like so much of what they do, sure, it "works", but it's completely transparent that they are fucking shit garbage people.
Yeah as much as I dislike fuckhead /u/spez he did a good job comparatively.
What do you mean? He has a youtube channel... Plenty of people here knew about him.
Ah got it.
1+ min videos are gone
Agree there, but the pre gme videos were the peak of this subs memes
Couldn't they just have banned the gme memes?  I miss the others.
I'M RECLAIMING MY TIME!!!

The left like to claim the moral high ground and then start spreading rumors you're a nazi or a homophobe. At least you know where you stand with the right when they act like giant assholes most of the time lmao.

Let me sleep on it, I'll give you an answer in the morning. Playing meatloaf to his answers
Well, regardless of whether you agree with her politics or not, that seems to be what AOC is doing. 

And look at all the death threats and adversarial maneuvering she contends with. 

Someone has to do it...
Exactly what an intern would say
Honestly I hope you are cause it would be real weird to be this deep in Katie Porters poop chute brown noser.
Good Vlad Bot
I am not a cat.

yea I posted on the big pinned thread earlier that Griffin looked like he was Morty - "I do as the Crystal guides..." you could see his eyes batting around and he was speaking so slow like he was try to copy a lip-sync for the right answer. But that's corporate/PR life. If one thing comes out of this whole debacle (and I know it probably won't), is that major companies are forced to be more transparent. There is so much that goes on behind the scenes and the fact that RH fucked over it's user base for it's own ass without any warning, clarity or explanation is totally fucked up.
just when you think someone is the bottom of the barrel, you experience a mole-person trying to dig up from beneath

&#x200B;

perspective is a bitch
“Nobody” is really just a hyperbole. Most people don’t watch his channel and since the article, his subscriber base has grown
What a bunch of ballsacks, with these rules The Tendiman shanty would never have happened...
Who is making these retarded rules. Those videos are half the reason I subbed.
The old super involved memes we’re what originally got me interested in this sub, this is sad
F
Agree with you on that, I loved the coke ad one someone did about TSLA mooning.
YES OR NO VLAD
Whoever programmed this bot, you were very very quick
God damn good bot
Delightful features
I get you're a cynical and think everyone is a self-serving asshole, but that aside... you should try and get someone to investigate how come your WSB were sold to for them to make money on you ;) Just trying to help you out here
You don't understand what's going on here, do you? I have no association whatsoever with Katie Porter, but I do believe she's the only person that will ask the real questions that need to be answered.  Not everyone is a self-serving feces smeller like you ;) and I'm being kind.
Yeah he only had 500 subs before.
That’s the problem exactly. If the meme is something catchy like a song, and it gets too viral, suddenly the market has to halt everything because retail investors are momentum trading with too much power.

Too real bro
 YES OR NO
Good bot
I have no stake in this fight. I am simply a concerned individual that would like to see transparency and accountability in the financial markets.
So real the market began cascading on day of trading freezes. I really want to just see it burn now, I have no faith left in the system. Even if you support capitalism as ardently as a conservative would, what has happened shows that the market isn’t free no matter how badly a conservative you are. The market isn’t free and the ones who control it only believe in the ideology of self-gratuity. Why aren’t we eating the rich over this?

Everyone should know there is no group of politicians having our back on any of this. It's obvious we've been getting fucked more and more. 

You see this all over the world and throughout history until people stop it, but the means to stop it are mostly being stripped away. 

Hopefully we can regain our collective power for good and stop the endless greed and unchecked abuse.
Good bot
YES OR NO?
Good bot
so do things need to be changed or not? you're contradicting your own statement
Fuck that, I don’t wanna hope for anything, I am truly curious for you to answer, why aren’t there people trying to eat the rich? Wage gap is staring people in the face for years now.

Either you're a turbo Virgin simping for a politician or a paid intern. Either way, shut the fuck up with that copy and paste bullshit you ain't one of us
