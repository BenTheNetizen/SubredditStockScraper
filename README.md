# SubredditStockScraper

# Summary
This program pulls data from Reddit using the Python Reddit API Wrapper and performs natural language processing (PRAW). Users chose a subreddit that includes stock discussions and the number of submissions they wish for the program to perform analysis on. SubredditStockScraper will look through the title, body, and comments of posts looking for the presence of stock tickers. Each appearance of a stock ticker increases its level of interest.
